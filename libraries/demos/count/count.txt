Paragraph Character/Word/Line Counting.

The Itsy Bitsy Counting Company has a job counting the
number of characters, words, and lines in a paragraph.

A paragraph is a sequence of 1 or more non-blank lines.

All the characters of a line count EXCEPT the trailing
new line.

A word is a sequence of non-space (non ' ') characters
on a line, and is separated from other words on the
same line by sequences of space ( ' ' ) characters.

The only whitespace characters in the input are space
and newline ( ' ' and '\n' ).  No line has more than
100 characters in it, not counting the new line at
the end.

Paragraphs are separated by one or more blank lines.
A blank line may have whitespace characters, but
nothing else.

The paragraphs in the input are numbered 1, 2, ... .
The program reads its standard input, and for each
paragraph in that input, prints the paragraph
number and the counts, in exactly the following format:

Paragraph #: # lines, # words, # characters.

where each # denotes 1 or more decimal digits.

Example Input:
------- -----

This is a good paragraph to start with.

And to continue in a bit more
complicated
vein,
this is a good paragraph.

But
 the
  ultimate
   in
    poetically
     possible
      paragraphs
       is
        this,
         or
          is
           it!




Oh Well.


Example Output:
------- ------


Paragraph 1: 1 lines, 8 words, 39 characters.
Paragraph 2: 4 lines, 14 words, 70 characters.
Paragraph 3: 12 lines, 12 words, 124 characters.
Paragraph 4: 1 lines, 2 words, 8 characters.
