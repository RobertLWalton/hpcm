Count Demo README	    Fri Apr 14 10:28:05 EDT 2006

The files in this demo directory are:

    public/count/Makefile	Commented Makefile.
    public/count/README		Usage Info.
    public/count/count.in	Judges input.
    public/count/count.test	Judges output.
    public/count/count.txt	Problem description.
    public/count/count1.c	Solution in C.
    public/count/count1.cc	Solution in C++.
    public/count/count1.java    Solution in JAVA.
    public/count/count1.lsp	Solution in COMMONLISP.

There may be other files used exclusively by the judge,
such as .rc, .jin, and .jtest files.

The Makefile is commented, as opposed to most problem
Makefiles.  For a non-demo problem you are only given
the .txt file and the Makefile.

To run the demo (under UNIX), first

    cp count1.yy count.yy

for exactly ONE of yy = c, cc, java, or lsp.  Then

	make

To check that the output is correct

	diff count.out count.test

Then to submit the demo

	make submit

To see what debugging print commands might look like,
try
	make debug

If you want to edit the solution you chose, you may
first need to

	chmod u+w count.yy

(for the right yy), to make the file writable.

You should try introducing an error in the file and
resubmitting to see the response.  If you are in a
contest that permits `in-submit' and `inout-submit',
try

	make in-submit

and then

	make inout-submit

with a source file that has an error which makes it
produce incorrect output.

Read the Makefile for more information.

If you have a non-UNIX system, you can submit the file
count1.yy directly by sending email to the judge with
subject `submit count.yy' (note there is no `1' here)
and body equal to the file count1.yy (here there is a
`1').  You may run count1.yy using your own system with
count.in as the standard input in order to generate
count.out.

Although in this directory the problem description is
in a .txt file, in other problem directories the problem
description may be in a .html, .htm, or .ps (postscript)
file.
