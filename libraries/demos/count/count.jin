*CASE-HEAD* ^[ \t]*paragraph
*CASE*
This is a good paragraph to start with.

*CASE*
And to continue in a bit more
complicated
vein,
this is a good paragraph.

*CASE*
But
 the
  ultimate
   in
    poetically
     possible
      paragraphs
       is
        this,
         or
          is
           it!




*CASE*
Oh Well.
