Word Order Reverser
---- ----- --------

You have been asked to read in a sentence and reverse
the order of the words in the sentence WITHOUT changing
the punctuation or spacing.  Thus

	hi there, george!

becomes

	george there, hi!


Input
-----

For each of several test cases, one line containing the
sentence to be word-reversed.  No line is longer than
80 characters.  To make things easier, all letters are
lower case.  Input ends with an end of file.


Output
------

For each test case one line which is just the input line
with the word substitutions so the order of the words
is reversed.  Only words are to be substituted: spaces
and punctuation are to be left as is.
