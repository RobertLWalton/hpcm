Word Order Reverser
---- ----- --------

Thompson Tommy is a well known pop poet who specializes
in word-reversed poetry.  This is poetry in which the
words in each line are presented in reverse order, but
the punctuation is left in place.

For example, one of his poems is

	moon! full the oh!
	swoon to me leads
	loon a of song the for!

Not everyone can stomach this, and you have been asked
to write a translator which will render Thompson Tommy's
poems readable.


Input
-----

You are being asked to translate a sequence of lines,
each no longer than 80 characters.  To make things
easier, all letters are lower case.  There may be blank
lines.  Input ends with an end of file.


Output
------

For each line output that line exactly as is but with
word substitutions, and only word substitutions.  The
last word is substituted for the first, the next to last
for the second, and so forth, until the first is substi-
tuted for the last.  Only words are to be substituted;
spaces and punctuation are to be left as is.  A word is
defined as a sequence of lower case letters, containing
NO non-letters.  A blank line translates to a blank
line.
