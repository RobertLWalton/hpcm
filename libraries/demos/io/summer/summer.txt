Summation Checking
--------- --------

The accountants have been using a Trusty (Crusty) Old
Computer for decades, but they have come to suspect its
recently acquired a gremlin in its adder.  So they have
reprogrammed it to produce audit files which list sets
of numbers to be summed and the resulting summation
according to their computer.  They want you to check
these files.


Input
-----

For each of several test cases, first a line containing
the test case name, and then one line containing the
set of numbers to be added followed by a `=' and ending
with the sum produced by the accountants computer.  That
is, this line will have the form

	NUMBER1 NUMBER2 NUMBER3 ... = SUM

The test case name lines will have at most 80 charac-
ters, but the lines with numbers can be very long.
There can be up to 10,000 numbers to be summed in one
test case.  All input numbers have exactly 2 decimal
places, and are in the range from -1,000,000 to
+ 1,000,000.

Input ends with an end of file.


Output
------

For each test case, first an exact copy of the test case
name line, and then one line of one of the forms

	SUM is correct

	SUM should be CORRECTED-SUM

All numbers output should have exactly 2 decimal points.


Sample Input
------ -----

-- SAMPLE 1 --
1.00 2.00 3.00 = 6.00
-- SAMPLE 2 --
1.00 2.00 3.00 = 6.01
-- SAMPLE 3 --
-0.01 +0.02 -0.01 = 0.00
-- SAMPLE 4 --
-0.01 +0.02 -0.02 = 0.00


Sample Output
------ ------

-- SAMPLE 1 --
6.00 is correct
-- SAMPLE 2 --
6.01 should be 6.00
-- SAMPLE 3 --
0.00 is correct
-- SAMPLE 4 --
0.00 should be -0.01
