Line Segment Intersections
---- ------- -------------

You are given two line segments, AB and CD, and you
must find out whether these intersect, and if so, which
of their endpoints are in the intersection, and the
length of the intersection.


Input
-----

For each of several test cases, one line of the format

    Ax Ay Bx By Cx Cy Dx Dy

where the line segment end points are A=(Ax,Ay),
B=(Bx,By), C=(Cx,Cy), and D=(Dx,Dy).  All x,y coordi-
nates are floating point numbers with precisely 3
decimal places.

Input ends with an end of file.


Output
------

For each test case one line containing

	NO INTERSECTION

if the test case line segments to not intersect, or a
line of the format

	INTERSECTION ends length

if the line segments do intersect.  Here ends is a list
of the end points involved in the intersection, if any,
and length is the length of the intersection.  The end
points must be listed in alphabetical order (ABCD) with
NO space between end points.  The length is 0 if the
intersection is just a point, but may be larger if the
line segments are parallel.  The length must have
exactly three decimal places.


Sample Input
------ -----

0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1
0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0
0 0 1 0 -1 0 0.5 0
0 0 1 0 0.5 0 1 0.5
0.1 0.1 0.9 0.9 0.1 0.1 0.9 0.9

Sample Output
------ ------

INTERSECTION AC 0.000
INTERSECTION  0.000
INTERSECTION AD 0.500
INTERSECTION C 0.000
INTERSECTION ABCD 1.131
