This directory contains code and data to accompany the chapter
Natural Language Corpus Data from the book Beautiful Data
(Segaran and Hammerbacher, 2009). If you like this you may

Data files are derived from the Google Web Trillion Word Corpus,
as described by Thorsten Brants and Alex Franz, and distributed
by the Linguistic Data Consortium.

Added by Bob Walton:

The Google Web Trillion Word Corpus appears to be under
licensing restrictions, the main gist of which is that it
must not be possible to reverse engineer the corpus from
any redistribution of data derived from it.  So I've
eliminated from Peter Norvig's redistribution the
information we do not need by running the Makefile:

most-common-50000-words-by-frequency.txt:
	sed -e 's/\t[0-9][0-9]*$$//' <count_1w.txt \
	    | head -n 50000 \
	      > most-common-50000-words-by-frequency.txt
