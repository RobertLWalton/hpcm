HPCM Status
---- ------

The current version is 1.0

Version 1.0:
------- ---

This is a beta test version, and the first public
release.  The programs that do the judging are almost
identical to those that were used in BOSPRE 2002 and
should be reliable.

Some features have never been used except for simple
testing.  These include any Files file in a solution
directory and all the features invokable by such a
file, and any non-standard response_instructions in
hpcm_judging.rc.


Version 0.0:
------- ---

This is an alpha test version.

The programs that do the judging are almost identical
to those that were used in Bospre 2000, and thus should
be fairly reliable.  Note, however, that during Bospre
2000 the `reply' program was used and NOT the `tracker'
program.  `tracker' needs some work, and may or may not
be useable in a contest.

The programs that set up a contest have been extensively
improved since Bospre 2000.
