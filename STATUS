HPCM Status
---- ------

The current version is 01_000.

Future Versions:
------ --------

Bob Walton has the ambition to spend some of 2004
refining HPCM so it can support a fully automatic
on-line course for very good or well tutored students.
The candidate course is one in Symbolic Programming
(see www.deas.harvard.edu/~walton).  Aside from
basic maintenance and regular contributions to the 
problem library, there are no other ambitions for HPCM.

Version 01_000:
------- ------

This is a beta test version, and the first public
release.  The programs that do the judging are almost
identical to those that were used in BOSPRE 2002 and
should be reliable.  They have evolved from BOSPRE 2000
to BOSPRE 2002.

Some features have never been used except for simple
testing.  These include any Files file in a solution
directory and all the features invokable by such a
file, and any non-standard response_instructions in
hpcm_judging.rc.


Version 00_000 (aka 1.0):
------- ------ ---------

This is an alpha test version.

The programs that do the judging are almost identical
to those that were used in BOSPRE 2000, and thus should
be fairly reliable.  Note, however, that during BOSPRE
2000 the `reply' program was used and NOT the `tracker'
program.  `tracker' needs some work, and may or may not
be usable in a contest.

The programs that set up a contest have been extensively
improved since BOSPRE 2000.  The scorediff program that
compares submitter's and judge's results has been re-
written since this version.  A number of other sub-
systems have been added or extensively improved since
this version.
