HPCM Status
---- ------

The current version is 01_001.

Future Versions:
------ --------

The current plan is to make a new version that better
supports average students by returning for failed
submissions the judge's test data that failed.  Just
the test case that failed is to be returned.

The second ambition is to support a fully automatic
on-line course for very good or well tutored students.
The candidate course is one in Symbolic Programming
(see www.deas.harvard.edu/~walton).

Aside from basic maintenance and regular contributions
to the problem library, there are no other ambitions
for HPCM.

Makefile	Changed version number to 01_001.

Lots of other stuff was changed in minor ways.


Version 01_000:
------- ------

This is a beta test version, and the first public
release.  The programs that do the judging are almost
identical to those that were used in BOSPRE 2002 and
should be reliable.  They have evolved from BOSPRE 2000
to BOSPRE 2002.

Extraction of message parts, quoted-printable, and
base64 text from email has been added very recently and
is more likely than other features of the basic judging
software to contain bugs.

Some features have never been used except for simple
testing.  These include any Files file in a solution
directory and all the features invokable by such a
file, and any non-standard response_instructions in
hpcm_judging.rc.


Version 00_000 (aka 0.0):
------- ------ ---------

This is an alpha test version.

The programs that do the judging are almost identical
to those that were used in BOSPRE 2000, and thus should
be fairly reliable.  Note, however, that during BOSPRE
2000 the `reply' program was used and NOT the `tracker'
program.  `tracker' needs some work, and may or may not
be usable in a contest.

The programs that set up a contest have been extensively
improved since BOSPRE 2000.  The scorediff program that
compares submitter's and judge's results has been re-
written since this version.  A number of other sub-
systems have been added or extensively improved since
this version.
