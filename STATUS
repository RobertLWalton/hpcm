This is an alpha test version.

The programs that do the judging are almost identical
to those that were used in Bospre 2000, and thus should
be fairly reliable.  Note, however, that during Bospre
2000 the `reply' program was used and NOT the `tracker'
program.  `tracker' needs some work, and may or may not
be useable in a contest.

The programs that set up a contest have been extensively
improved since Bospre 2000.
