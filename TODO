Software
--------

String trim does not remove \f or \v.  Replace where
needed by string trim ... "\ \t\r\n\f\v".

Replace use of tcl by tclsh using something like:

    # The next lines start an uninterruptable tclsh \
    trap "" HUP INT QUIT; umask 77; \
    exec `dirname "$0"`/tclsh "$0" "$@"

Make it easier to convert a formal contest to an
informal contest after the contest is over.

Write a print_index_files program to print an index and
all files listed in it.  There should be options to
control this process.  There should be an easy way to
make to make a postscript file consisting of just
`this_contest + problems + PROBLEM-STATEMENTS', for
instance.

If autoinfo finds 0 files to return, it returns
NO email message.

Create an info_extension_map that permits extensions
to be mapped, and permits info to NOT return .rc
files.

Add recipient filter to receivemail so system is not
dependent on procmail.

Write hpcm_help for email/sh.

The documentation .txt files should contain the HPCM
version number.

There should be tools for backing up contests during
a contest, to guard against computer failure.
Currently this can be easily done with a small
script, but such scripts need to be standardized,
and tools for enabling/disabling accounts on a backup
computer are needed.


Documentation
-------------


Done but Not Sufficiently Tested
--------------------------------

The Files file in a solution directory and all the
features invokable from it have never been used in prac-
tice.  Ditto for non-standard response instructions.

Problem Library
------- -------

Many problems need .jin files.

The crypto problem needs a multiple solution form with
a Scoring_Filter.
