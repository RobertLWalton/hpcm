Software
--------

Adjust the top margin on fprint and print2 to
give more space so 3-holed punching works better.  Currently
fprint prints 49 lines.  (This turns out to be HARD.)

The tracker program needs work.  In particular it could
use summary statistics producing commands, and help
commands.

A scoresort program needs to be written that will sort
all blocks between blank lines, where a block is a
sequence of lines beginning with a line that begins with
a non-whitespace character.  This can be applied to the
crypto problem in its multiple solution form.

Scorediff gets confused on spacebreak if ws occurs at the beginning
(or end)? of a file.  Scorediff should be completely rewritten
to be properly token organized.

Write a print_index_files program to print an index and all
files listed in it.

Make the print programs send postscript in email if
.hpcm_contest/printer is `email'.

Change the scoreboard output to list number of problems
correct in a column (is this a good idea? maybe it should
be an option).

Write hpcm_help for email/sh.

Permit .htm and .html files in addition to .txt files as
problem descriptions.

Problems
--------

Hypercube problem solution crashes and this problem is
currently disabled in the problem_directory index.  Fix.

The public/motion problem needs work.  Its .out and .test
do not match (at least on some machines).   It may not
have a stable output.
