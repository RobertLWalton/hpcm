Hypercube problem solution crashes and this problem is
currently disabled in the problem_directory index.  Fix.

A scoresort program needs to be written that will sort
all blocks between blank lines, where a block is a
sequence of lines beginning with a line that begins with
a non-whitespace character.  This can be applied to the
crypto problem in its multiple solution form.

Everywhere there is #!/bin/sh -f the -f should be removed.

Move public/partition to private/partition.
