Software
--------

Adjust the top margin on fprint and print2 to
give more space so 3-holed punching works better.  Currently
fprint prints 49 lines.

A scoresort program needs to be written that will sort
all blocks between blank lines, where a block is a
sequence of lines beginning with a line that begins with
a non-whitespace character.  This can be applied to the
crypto problem in its multiple solution form.

Scorediff gets confused on spacebreak if ws occurs at the beginning
(or end)? of a file.  Rewrite scorediff to be properly
token organized.

Write a print_index_files program to print an index and all
files listed in it.

Retest TRASH_ACCOUNT.

Write SETUP_PROTOTYPE.

Make the print programs send postscript in email if
.hpcm_contest/printer is `email'.

Write freeze_scoreboard.

Write hpcm_help for email/sh.

Permit .htm and .html files in addition to .txt files as
problem descriptions.

Problems
--------

Hypercube problem solution crashes and this problem is
currently disabled in the problem_directory index.  Fix.

The public/motion problem needs work.  Its .out and .test
do not match (at least on some machines).   It may not
have a stable output.
