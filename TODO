Software
--------

Add `legal' emails for Bob Walton and Dan Ellard.

The tracker program needs work.  In particular it could
use summary statistics producing commands, and help
commands.

A scoresort program needs to be written that will sort
all blocks between blank lines, where a block is a
sequence of lines beginning with a line that begins with
a non-whitespace character.  This can be applied to the
crypto problem in its multiple solution form.

Scorediff should be completely rewritten to be properly
token organized, and to report a short `proof' of its
findings (the key lines that have differences).

Write a print_index_files program to print an index and all
files listed in it.

Allow # comment lines in an index file, and add the
usual authoring info to such files.

Make the print programs send postscript in email if
.hpcm_contest/printer is `email'.

Write hpcm_help for email/sh.

Provide a way for the judge to easily comment on the code
of a submission, for the case when HPCM is being used
in a course for problem submissions.

Provide a way for a multifile submission, for the case when
HPCM is being used in a course for problem submissions.

Problems
--------

The public/motion problem needs work.  Its .out and .test
do not match (at least on some machines).   It may not
have a stable output.
