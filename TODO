Software
--------

String trim does not remove \f or \v.  Replace where
needed by string trim ... "\ \t\r\n\f\v".

Replace use of tcl by tclsh using something like:

    # The next lines start an uninterruptable tclsh \
    trap "" HUP INT QUIT; umask 77; \
    exec `dirname "$0"`/tclsh "$0" "$@"

Make it easier to convert a formal contest to an
informal contest after the contest is over.

Write a print_index_files program to print an index and
all files listed in it.  There should be options to
control this process.  There should be an easy way to
make to make a postscript file consisting of just
`this_contest + problems + PROBLEM-STATEMENTS', for
instance.

If autoinfo finds 0 files to return, it returns
NO email message.

Eliminate `Files' file in a solution directory in favor
of putting its information in the PROBLEM.rc file.

The scorediff and autojudge programs should be revised
to permit .in and .test etc to be separated into test
cases, and permit reporting all the input and optionally
all the judge's output up through the first failed test
case to the contestant.  The scoreboard should permit
some scoring system not based on time, but based on
number of submissions and number requesting all input
up through first failed test case, and number of input+
output up through first failed test case.

To separate .in and .test have for each a string which
begins the first line of each case.  The default is
========== (10 ='s).  Program scorediff to ignore lines
starting with this string in its inputs.  Program
autojudge to create .in from .jin by deleting lines
with this string.  As an option, suppress the ignoring
and deleting to allow formats that inherently identify
test cases.

Also allow more than one .in file.  Instead of just
PROBLEM.in, allow PROBLEM_yyy.in, PROBLEM_yyy.test, etc.

The scorediff program should be rewritten to skip over
non-matching lines to find following matching lines,
rather than slavishly comparing successive tokens after
a mismatch has been found.  It should be more like UNIX
diff, but should require matches keep file order.  The
result will be more useful for automatic grading of
problem sets, where failure in one part of the test
should not imply failure in subsequent parts.

Create an info_extension_map that permits extensions
to be mapped, and permits info to NOT return .rc
files.

Add recipient filter to receivemail so system is not
dependent on procmail.

Write hpcm_help for email/sh.

The documentation .txt files should contain the HPCM
version number.


Documentation
-------------


Done but Not Sufficiently Tested
--------------------------------

The Files file in a solution directory and all the
features invokable from it have never been used in prac-
tice.  Ditto for non-standard response instructions.

Problem Library
------- -------

The crypto problem needs a multiple solution form with
a Scoring_Filter.
