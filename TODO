Software
--------

It would be nice if the contestant print commands
handled .ps, .pdf, .htm, and .html files.  Adding -Z
to the enscript command would handle .ps files, but
not the others.

Makecontest does not group read-protect
./contest/secure.

Makescoreboard does not update scoreboard_instructions
when it changes in the parameter file.

Manualreply needs to be fixed so asking for any
file named XXXXdiff (XXXXbdiff) produces a diff file
if XXXXout and XXXXtest exist.

The tracker program should use the Needs_Reply_Flag
to automatically call `ls', or at least indicate it
should be called.

Fix help/sh/procmailrc to have ^L => #^L.  Fix so
it uses | /usr/sbin/sendmail -oi -t and not
|procmailrc.  (hpcm_extract does not produce From
lines?)

String trim does not remove \f or \v.  Replace where
needed by string trim ... "\ \t\r\n\f\v".

Replace use of tcl by tclsh using something like:

    # The next lines start an uninterruptable tclsh \
    trap "" HUP INT QUIT; umask 77; \
    exec `dirname "$0"`/tclsh "$0" "$@"

If autoinfo finds 0 files to return, it returns
NO email message.

Create an info_extension_map that permits extensions
to be mapped, and permits info to NOT return .rc
files.  This may in effect be already done.

Add recipient filter to receivemail so system is not
dependent on procmail.

The documentation .txt files should contain the HPCM
version number.  Maybe.

There should be tools for backing up contests during
a contest, to guard against computer failure.
Currently this can be easily done with a small
script, but such scripts need to be standardized,
and tools for enabling/disabling accounts on a backup
computer are needed.

Problem Library
------- -------

Many problems need .jin files.

The crypto problem needs a multiple solution form with
a Scoring_Filter.
