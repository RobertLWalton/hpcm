Software
--------

Makescoreboard will not recompute a missing scoreboard.1
unless flag/Score_Flag is set.

help/common/c++ should say that istringstream with
integer last thing in buffer has eof immediately after
reading integer, and to check for eof you should >> ws
and test eof before reading an integer.

Make `scoreboard'Â display the scoreboard for the judge.

It would be nice to merge problem_library/Makefile[12].
One needs to do something about testproblems to do so.
Also vexing/Files needs to be changed to vexing.rc.

test_submissions should be sent to a test account and
tested there.

Manualreply needs to be fixed so asking for any
file named XXXXdiff (XXXXbdiff) produces a diff file
if XXXXout and XXXXtest exist.

Debugging should be built into the Makefile.  E.g.,
`make debug'.  Instructions on how to write trace
code should be in help files, e.g. c++.

The tracker program should use the Needs_Reply_Flag
to automatically call `ls', or at least indicate it
should be called.

Fix help/sh/procmailrc to have ^L => #^L.  Fix so
it uses | /usr/sbin/sendmail -oi -t and not
|procmailrc.  (hpcm_extract does not produce From
lines?)

String trim does not remove \f or \v.  Replace where
needed by string trim ... "\ \t\r\n\f\v".

Replace use of tcl by tclsh using something like:

    # The next lines start an uninterruptable tclsh \
    trap "" HUP INT QUIT; umask 77; \
    exec `dirname "$0"`/tclsh "$0" "$@"

If autoinfo finds 0 files to return, it returns
NO email message.

Create an info_extension_map that permits extensions
to be mapped, and permits info to NOT return .rc
files.  This may in effect be already done.

Add recipient filter to receivemail so system is not
dependent on procmail.

Write hpcm_help for email/sh.

The documentation .txt files should contain the HPCM
version number.  Maybe.

There should be tools for backing up contests during
a contest, to guard against computer failure.
Currently this can be easily done with a small
script, but such scripts need to be standardized,
and tools for enabling/disabling accounts on a backup
computer are needed.

Problem Library
------- -------

Many problems need .jin files.

The crypto problem needs a multiple solution form with
a Scoring_Filter.
