Hypercube problem solution crashes and this problem is
currently disabled in the problem_directory index.  Fix.

A scoresort program needs to be written that will sort
all blocks between blank lines, where a block is a
sequence of lines beginning with a line that begins with
a non-whitespace character.  This can be applied to the
crypto problem in its multiple solution form.

Everywhere there is #!/bin/sh -f the -f should be removed.

Move public/partition to private/partition.

The public/motion problem needs work.  Its .out and .test
do not match (at least on some machines).   It may not
have a stable output.

New problems from BOSPRE2000 need to be installed as
public or private (which?).

Fix print, print2, fprint so the header does not overflow.

Scorediff gets confused on spacebreak if ws occurs at the beginning
(or end)? of a file.

Write a print_index_files program to print an index and all
files listed in it.

Retest TRASH_ACCOUNT.
