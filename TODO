Software
--------

A judging document should be written describing how
to set up the judging file, how to do judging, how
to handle some system overflow problems.

In manualreply, typing pr when there is no .score file
causes a system error.

The x, score, and ss commands should work from pr.

The x command should work for tracker.

Tracker should be able to exec lookat and vic versa.

Lookat needs a help command and ability to call itself
with a new expression.

Its hard to go to the next and previous directories
in lookat.

The scoreboard control stuff should all be in parameter
files.  There should be provision for multiple scoreboards,
composition of scoreboards from parts according to size,
etc.

Add `legal' emails for Bob Walton and Dan Ellard.

The tracker program needs work.  In particular it could
use summary statistics producing commands, and help
commands.

A scoresort program needs to be written that will sort
all blocks between blank lines, where a block is a
sequence of lines beginning with a line that begins with
a non-whitespace character.  This can be applied to the
crypto problem in its multiple solution form.

It should in general be possible to filter the .out,
.in, and .test files through a program provided by the judge.
For example, such a program could test whether .out contained
a legal solution as optimal as the .test solution.

Write a print_index_files program to print an index and all
files listed in it.

Make the print programs send postscript in email if
.hpcm_contest/printer is `email'.

Write hpcm_help for email/sh.

Provide a way for the judge to easily comment on the code
of a submission, for the case when HPCM is being used
in a course for problem submissions.

Provide a way for a multifile submission, for the case when
HPCM is being used in a course for problem submissions.

Problems
--------

The public/motion problem needs work.  Its .out and .test
do not match (at least on some machines).   It may not
have a stable output.
