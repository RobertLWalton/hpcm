Software
--------

String trim does not remove \f or \v.  Replace where needed
by string trim ... "\ \t\r\n\f\v".

Replace use of tcl by tclsh using something like:

    # The next lines start an uninterruptable tclsh \
    trap "" HUP INT QUIT; umask 77; \
    exec `dirname "$0"`/tclsh "$0" "$@"

For the html pages, <comment> does not work, and needs to be
replaced by <!-- ... -->.

Make it easier to convert a formal contest to an
informal contest after the contest is over.

Write a print_index_files program to print an index and
all files listed in it.  There should be options to
control this process.  There should be an easy way to
make to make a postscript file consisting of just
`this_contest + problems + PROBLEM-STATEMENTS', for
instance.

If autoinfo finds 0 files to return, it returns
NO email message.

The scorediff program should be rewritten to skip over
non-matching lines to find following matching lines,
rather than slavishly comparing successive tokens after
a mismatch has been found.  It should be more like UNIX
diff, but should require matches keep file order.  The
result will be more useful for automatic grading of
problem sets, where failure in one part of the test
should not imply failure in subsequent parts.

Create an info_extension_map that permits extensions
to be mapped, and permits info to NOT return .rc
files.

Add recipient filter to receivemail so system is not
dependent on procmail.

Write hpcm_help for email/sh.

The Files file in a solution directory might be elimi-
nated in favor of putting its information in the
PROBLEM.rc file.

The documentation .txt files should contain the HPCM
version number.


Documentation
-------------


Done but Not Sufficiently Tested
--------------------------------

The Files file in a solution directory and all the
features invokable from it have never been used in prac-
tice.  Ditto for non-standard response instructions.

Problem Library
------- -------

The crypto problem needs a multiple solution form with
a Scoring_Filter.
