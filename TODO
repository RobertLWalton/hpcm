Hypercube problem solution crashes and this problem is
currently disabled in the problem_directory index.  Fix.

A scoresort program needs to be written that will sort
all blocks between blank lines, where a block is a
sequence of lines beginning with a line that begins with
a non-whitespace character.  This can be applied to the
crypto problem in its multiple solution form.

Everywhere there is #!/bin/sh -f the -f should be removed.

Move public/partition to private/partition.

The public/motion problem needs work.  Its .out and .test
do not match (at least on some machines).   It may not
have a stable output.


autoinfo should not combine files returned with error
messages as the error messages may be lost in the
extractor.  It should also adj the subject in the
files returne or error message so both do not go
to the extractor.
