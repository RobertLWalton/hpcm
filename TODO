Software
--------

Currently submitting a file with no final newline character
breaks submission by gluing HPCM_END to the end of the last
submitted line.  Fix this so such files can be submitted.

solution-submit xxx.java will not return a solution if the
solution is not written in java.

w3m mysteriously goes into a mode where it aborts on being
called with a url or local file.  It stays in this mode for
a day and then starts working again.

remakeMakefile needs to permit individual Makefiles to have
customizable parts.

The aj manualreply command should have variants to delete
various files before rerunning the autojudge, and there should
be better documentation available in manual reply about this.

Increase the max filesize in problem Makefiles from
50k to 200k.  Maybe increase other things to take
account of larger computers.

Have makecontest keep a log of what it outputs to the
terminal.

On email submissions with attachments, some of the modern
attachment types that should not be rejected are rejected.

Investigate the `sheep' problem which has a `monitor'
instead of a `scoring filter', and standardize how this
is to be done.  A `monitor' is a program that runs the
submitted program as a subprocess.  Submission program
I/O is between it an the monitor.  The monitor reads
the .in and writes the .out.  The monitor is provided
by the judge; typically as a binary.

Add case-required to scoring instructions to indicate
that letter case errors are incorrect and not just
formatting errors.

Add column-required so plots are incorrect if things
are in the wrong columns.  Have this triggered by
a regexp so it need not apply to every line.  Perhaps
a `plot-regexp' that turns on column-required and
turns off number processing, or something.

Solution files are defined in two different ways.
They are defined by problem_solution_files for
web page making, and by the union of problem_required_
files and problem_optional_files for `solution'
qualifier.  They should be defined by problem_solution_
files in either case.  Also, make solution-submit
with a .java contestant solution tries and usually fails
to return a .java judge's solution file.

Have problems with private .in files import these with
ln -s commands using problem_make_files.

It would be nice if the contestant print commands
handled .ps, .pdf, .htm, and .html files.  Adding -Z
to the enscript command would handle .ps files, but
not the others.

Manualreply needs to be fixed so asking for any
file named XXXXdiff (XXXXbdiff) produces a diff file
if XXXXout and XXXXtest exist.  Actually, this may
have already been done.

The tracker program should use the Needs_Reply_Flag
to automatically call `ls', or at least indicate it
should be called.

String trim does not remove \f or \v.  Replace where
needed by string trim ... "\ \t\r\n\f\v".

Replace use of tcl by tclsh using something like:

    # The next lines start an uninterruptable tclsh \
    trap "" HUP INT QUIT; umask 77; \
    exec `dirname "$0"`/tclsh "$0" "$@"

If autoinfo finds 0 files to return, it returns
NO email message.  The get_bad_body test produces
odd results when run from a personal account using
procmailrc.

Create an info_extension_map that permits extensions
to be mapped, and permits info to NOT return .rc
files.  This may in effect be already done.

Add recipient filter to receivemail so system is not
dependent on procmail.

The documentation .txt files should contain the HPCM
version number.  Maybe.

There should be tools for backing up contests during
a contest, to guard against computer failure.
Currently this can be easily done with a small
script, but such scripts need to be standardized,
and tools for enabling/disabling accounts on a backup
computer are needed.


Documentation
-------------

Problem Library
------- -------

whoisalive should sort the presidents names in
alphabetical order according to the problem
description, but the current solution and the examples
in the html file do not.

merc-2000 problems need documentation.  Also, their
.in, .test, etc. files need to be made private.

Many problems need .jin files.

The crypto problem needs a multiple solution form with
a Scoring_Filter.
