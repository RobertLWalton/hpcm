Software
--------

If you `touch hpcm_judging.rc' after startcontest
starts, then `startcontest' crashes.

Absence or presence of blank lines is being scored
Incorrect Output instead of Formatting Error because
of boc mismatch.  This only happens when blank lines
are used as case head or separator.

Add case-required to scoring instructions to indicate
that letter case errors are incorrect and not just
formatting errors.

Solution files are defined in two different ways.
They are defined by problem_solution_files for
web page making, and by the union of problem_required_
files and problem_optional_files for `solution'
qualifier.  In theory required and optional files
should be solution files, though there may be more
solution files.  Perhaps problem_solution_files
should default to problem_required_files +
problem_optional_files?

Have problems with private .in files import these with
ln -s commands using problem_make_files.

It would be nice if the contestant print commands
handled .ps, .pdf, .htm, and .html files.  Adding -Z
to the enscript command would handle .ps files, but
not the others.

Manualreply needs to be fixed so asking for any
file named XXXXdiff (XXXXbdiff) produces a diff file
if XXXXout and XXXXtest exist.  Actually, this may
have already been done.

The tracker program should use the Needs_Reply_Flag
to automatically call `ls', or at least indicate it
should be called.

String trim does not remove \f or \v.  Replace where
needed by string trim ... "\ \t\r\n\f\v".

Replace use of tcl by tclsh using something like:

    # The next lines start an uninterruptable tclsh \
    trap "" HUP INT QUIT; umask 77; \
    exec `dirname "$0"`/tclsh "$0" "$@"

If autoinfo finds 0 files to return, it returns
NO email message.  The get_bad_body test produces
odd results when run from a personal account using
procmailrc.

Create an info_extension_map that permits extensions
to be mapped, and permits info to NOT return .rc
files.  This may in effect be already done.

Add recipient filter to receivemail so system is not
dependent on procmail.

The documentation .txt files should contain the HPCM
version number.  Maybe.

There should be tools for backing up contests during
a contest, to guard against computer failure.
Currently this can be easily done with a small
script, but such scripts need to be standardized,
and tools for enabling/disabling accounts on a backup
computer are needed.


Documentation

Problem Library
------- -------

RIT-2003 needs integration into the index.

RIT-2004 needs finishing and integration into index.

RIT-2005 needs finishing.

whoisalive should sort the presidents names in
alphabetical order according to the problem
description, but the current solution and the examples
in the html file do not.

merc-2000 problems need documentation.  Also, their
.in, .test, etc. files need to be made private.

Many problems need .jin files.

The crypto problem needs a multiple solution form with
a Scoring_Filter.
