Software
--------

Create an info_extension_map that permits extensions
to be mapped, and permits info to NOT return .rc
files.

Add recipient filter to receivemail so system is not
dependent on procmail.

A scoresort program needs to be written that will sort
all blocks between blank lines, where a block is a
sequence of lines beginning with a line that begins with
a non-whitespace character.  This can be applied to the
crypto problem in its multiple solution form.

Write a print_index_files program to print an index and
all files listed in it.

Write hpcm_help for email/sh.

The Files file in a solution directory might be elimi-
nated in favor of putting its information in the
PROBLEM.rc file.


Documentation

Done but Not Sufficiently Tested
--------------------------------

The Files file in a solution directory and all the
features invokable from it have never been used in prac-
tice.  Ditto for non-standard response instructions.
