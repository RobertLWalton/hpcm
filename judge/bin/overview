Features
--------

The Harvard Programming Contest Manager, HPCM, has the
following features:

    o Supports different kinds of programming contests:

    	email	    Contestants supply their own ac-
		    counts and communicate with the
		    judge by email to get problems and
		    submit solutions.  Contestants may
		    compete at any time.

	informal    Contestants are given accounts which
		    they can use locally or remotely at
		    any time to get problems and submit
		    solutions.

	formal	    Contestants are given accounts and
		    printouts of problems at a fixed
		    contest starting time.

    o Has an automatic judge, that can be used exclu-
      sively, or as an aid to a human judge.

    o Has a library of problems and supports easy semi-
      automated creation of new contests.

    o Keeps a complete log of everything that happens
      during contests in the form of files that can be
      easily analyzed for different purposes.

    o Is written modularly in TCL and Bourne Shell (sh)
      so that HPCM can easily be adapted and modified.


Requirements
------------

HPCM currently requires a UNIX system with Bourne shell
and TCL language interpreters.

A couple of programs require the `read -r' Bourne
shell command, and a Bourne shell `echo' command that
does not specially interpret the `\\' character.  If you
are using a UNIX system whose Bourne shell does not
support these features, the simplest fix is to import
the GNU Bourne shell, bash, and fix the programs con-
taining `read -r' to use it (these programs are current-
ly hpcm_extract and SET_PROTOTYPE).

TCL can be obtained at:	 	www.scriptics.com

Bash can be obtained at:

	www.gnu.org/software/bash/bash.html


Installing HPCM
---------- ----

There is a separate document, `Installing HPCM', that
describes how to obtain and install HPCM.  HPCM can be
obtained from

	www.deas.harvard.edu/~hc3/hpcm


Creating a Contest
-------- - -------

To create a contest, first read the help files

	hpcm/contestant/help/*/*

to get a good idea of what you are creating.  The file

	hpcm/contestant/help/index

explains what each of these files contains and suggests
an order in which these files may be read.

Then choose the type of contest you want to create
(email, informal, formal) and read the instructions in

	hpcm/examples/<contest-type>_contest/Makefile

This file also contains basic advice on how to judge
the contest.

You should also read

	hpcm/judge/lib/hpcm_judging.rc

and try to understand the parameters in that file as
best you can.

In order to better understand what you are doing, you
may wish to read the following overview, and then read
the individual program documentation for some of the
programs used to set up or judge contests.


Data and Programs
---- --- --------

HPCM handles different categories of data:

Library Data
    Problem descriptions, help documentation files,
    example contest parameter files.

Contest Definition Data
    Files that define a contest, including documentation
    for contestants, problem definition, solution defi-
    nition, and contest parameter definition.

Contest Raw Data
    Files that capture submissions and information gen-
    erated during judging, such as binary program files,
    output files, scores, and email replies.

Contest Derived Data
    Scoreboards and contest tracking summaries.


HPCM also contains several different categories of
programs:

Contestant Programs
    Programs run by contestants during a contest.

Judging Programs
    Programs run to judge a contest.

Contest Making Programs
    Programs run to make a contest.

Maintenance Programs
    Programs run to maintain the library, produce doc-
    umentation, or test the HPCM system.

Library Data: Problems
------- ----- --------

The problem library consists of the subdirectory tree
rooted at

	hpcm/problem_library

Each problem (and each demonstration problem) has its
own directory within the problem library.  The last
component of the name of this directory is the name of
the problem, and is also the basename of files describ-
ing the problem and solving the problem.

The library problem directories are placed within one of
three subdirectories of the hpcm/problem_library direc-
tory:

	demos	Demonstration problems.

	public	Problems that can be freely distributed
		to the public, without any restriction
		on verbatim copying, without any re-
		strictions on verbatim redistribution,
		and with no restriction on alteration
		unless otherwise indicated.

	private	Problems that cannot be redistributed
		to the public.  These have been taken
		off the web in most cases, and can be
		distributed to true friends and colla-
		borators or other members of your uni-
		versity, but cannot be placed on the web
		or be made available to strangers.

The problem directories are listed in the

	hpcm/problem_library/index

file, which can be input to the makejudgingdir program
to define which problems are to be used in a particular
contest, and to create an index of these problems.

Emails giving permission to make various problems public
are in the directory

	hpcm/problem_library/legal


If a problem has name `pppp', then the problem has a
problem directory named `pppp' within one of the
directories just mentioned, and the following files
within this problem directory describe the problem:

    pppp.txt	Problem description.

    Makefile	Gives instructions for compiling and
                running the problem solution.

These files are made available to the contestant, though
in a formal contest only Makefiles are made available
electronically, and pppp.txt files are only made avail-
able as a printout (to prevent contestants from emailing
an electronic version to cohorts for advice).

In order to be able to score a problem, three more files
are placed in the problem directory within the program
library:

    pppp.in		    The judge's test input.
    pppp.test		    The judge's test output.
    Scoring_Instructions    Optional file containing
    			    parameters that control how
			    the automatic scoring is
			    done (e.g., what numeric
			    tolerances are permitted).
			    See the documentation of
			    the `autoscore' program.

A contest has a solutions directory that contains sym-
bolic links to the library problem directories for every
problem that can be judged during the contest.  The
files just mentioned become input to the judging.

In addition to the files already mentioned, the library
problem directory usually contains a judge's solution
written in one of the contest programming languages.
The solution is written as a file whose extension indi-
cates the programming language of the solution.  Typical
possibilities are:

    pppp.c	C language solution.
    pppp.cc	C++ language solution.
    pppp.java	JAVA language solution.
    pppp.p	PASCAL language solution.

The programming languages allowed may vary; but every
solution language must be explicitly supported by the
problem Makefile.

It is possible to compile and run the solution within
the library problem directory in the same manner as
a problem is compiled and run by contestants and by the
judge.  Doing this results in making temporary files
that can be removed by the `make clean' command in the
problem directory.

Compilation creates a temporary binary file named `pppp'
and may create other temporary files for some languages:

    pppp	    The executable program binary.
    pppp*.class	    JAVA class files.
    pppp.p2c	    C translation of PASCAL program.

The solution is written to take input from the standard
input (the terminal by default) and put output to the
standard output (also the terminal by default).  The
Makefile contrives to run the program with resource
limits and so that the standard input and output are
mapped to the pppp.in file and the pppp.out file, re-
spectively.  Running the solution program using the
Makefile reads or creates the following temporary files:

    pppp.in	Solution input.
    pppp.out	Solution output.
    core	Dump of program if it crashes.

It is important to note that the solution code should
NOT open any files.  Also, the standard error output is
sent to the terminal, and NOT to a file.

The `make' command in the problem directory makes the
binary program if that does not exist or it is older
than the solution source file, and then makes the
pppp.out file if that does not exist or it is older than
the binary file or the .in file.

If a problem directory symbolically linked into a con-
test solutions directory has a pppp.out file, this file
will be treated as the judge's output in PREFERENCE to
any pppp.test file.  Thus if a judge finds an error in
the judge's solution, the judge merely needs to fix
the judge's solution and run the `make' command in the
solution problem directory to fix the judge's output.
After the contest the judge can replace the pppp.test
file by a copy of the correct pppp.out file.

However, there is a difficulty with running JAVA
solutions in a library problem directory using `make'.
The judge's hpcm_sandbox program runs the binary as
a user named `sandbox' that cannot access the problem
directory using an absolute pathname.  Unfortunately,
existing JAVA systems have a bug that causes them to
convert relative pathnames of .class files into absolute
pathnames before they are used, so the .class files
cannot be found by the `sandbox' user.  The fix for this
currently is to run the progams manually by

	pppp <pppp.in >pppp.out

Lastly, the `make clean' command in the problem direc-
tory deletes all temporary files, including `pppp',
`pppp.out', `core', and `.class' files.


Library Data: Help Documentation
------- ----- ---- -------------

The help documentation files reside in the subdirectory
tree rooted at

	hpcm/contestant/help

A help file index (in a format prescribed by the
`makejudgingdir' program) is in

	hpcm/contestant/help/index

Each `help' file is a short ASCII text document on some
topic contestants may need to know about.  For example,
there is a `help' file on the mechanics of solving a
problem (what files to write, how to compile, etc.).

The help files have a 56 column times 40 line format
that permits them to be printed two file pages per
paper page using a reasonable size font.  The fprint
program prints these files: the fcheck program checks
that they have no line longer than 56 columns and no
page longer than 40 lines.

The subdirectories of `hpcm/contestant/help' are
as follows:

    common	Help files used for all kinds of con-
    		tests (email, informal, and formal).

    email	Help files used for email contests only.

    email/sh	Code written in the Bourne Shell (sh)
    		language that can be used by contestants
		of an email contest on their own com-
		puters.

    informal	Help files used for informal contests
    		only.

    formal	Help files used for formal contests
    		only.

The `email/sh' subdirectory contains actual code.  If
similar code is written in other languages, e.g. tcl,
other subdirectories, e.g. `email/tcl', would be
created.


Library Data: Example Contests
------- ----- ------- --------

Subdirectories of

	hpcm/examples

contain parameter files necessary to set up a specific
type of contest.  Some of these subdirectories are:

    email_contest	Example email contest.

    informal_contest	Example informal contest.

    formal_contest	Example formal contest.

    test_contest	A `test contest' that merely
    			tests the autojudge.

Each of these subdirectories contains a Makefile that
contains documentation on how to use the files in the
subdirectory.  Typically this documentation tells how
to create a contest by making a judging directory, copy-
ing the files in the `hpcm/examples' subdirectory into
the judging directory, editing these copies, etc.


Contest Definition Data: The Judging Directory
------- ---------- ----- --- ------- ---------

A contest is defined by a collection of directories and
files, and by a few lines in parameter files that are
shared among many contests (e.g., ~/.procmailrc).

The heart of the contest is the judging directory.  This
typically has a name of the form:

	~/judging_cccc_ppppppppppp

where cccc is the name of the contest and ppppppppppp is
a string of random numbers and letters that makes the
directory name hard to guess.  The reason for this is
that in order to run JAVA code in a sandbox, all the
directories on the path from the root directory to the
program directories have to have a+x permissions (this
is a security bug in JAVA, surely), so to prohibit out-
siders from getting into the judge's subdirectory tree
it is necessary that the judging directory name be un-
guessable.

Fortunately the judge really does not need to use the
full name of the judging directory except in vary rare
instances, as `~/judging_cccc_*' or the equivalent
suffices.  The judge's account has u+r permission on
directories, so the `*' works for the judge's account,
but there is NO read permission on the directories for
outside users.

The judging directory contains the hpcm_judging.rc file
that defines parameters for the contest.  Whenever most
HPCM programs in hpcm/judge/bin are executed, they
search the current directory and its ancestors for a
file named hpcm_judging.rc.  If a program finds one such
file, it uses that to define the contest parameters, and
uses the directory that file is in as the contest jud-
ging directory.  It is an error if the program finds two
such files.  Therefore, one judging directory cannot be
the ancestor of another judging directory.  However,
one judging account can have many judging directories,
each the root of a disjoint subtree of directories.
Therefore one judging account can judge many contests.

The judging directory contains several components that
define the contest, in addition to many components that
belong to the raw data of the contest, and are listed
elsewhere below.  Starting from a few contest defining
components, the other contest defining components can
be made automatically by the `makejudgingdir' program.

The contest defining components of the judging directory
are:

    hpcm_judging.rc
        The contest parameters file.  This is editted
	by hand to define the contest.

    solutions
        The solution directory for the contest.  Each
	component of the solution directory is a symbol-
	lic link to a problem directory.  Often these
	problem directories are in the problem library.

	But for formal contests problems are often used
	that have not yet been entered into the problem
	library, and the problem directories for these
	are usually in a special (and secure) directory
	that has an index file listing the problems.
	This index file is in a format suitable for the
	`makejudgingdir' program.

	The solutions directory and its contents are
	made automatically by `makejudgingdir'.

    info
        The info directory for the contest.  This only
	exists for email and informal contests, and it
	is the root of a subdirectory tree that holds
	the files that can be obtained by contestants
	via email (the contestants often use hpcm_get
	which for email and formal contests uses email
	under the hood).  Thus the contents of the info
	directory proper are just three subdirectories:
	help, demos, and problems.  These in turn con-
	tain files and subdirectories.  The files
	proper are typically represented by symbolic
	links: see `makejudgingdir' documentation.

	The info directory and its contents are made
	automatically by `makejudgingdir'.

    contest
        The contest directory of the contest.  Actually,
	this is not a subdirectory proper of the judging
	directory, but `contest' in the judging direc-
	tory is symbolically linked to the contest
	directory.  This is because the contest direct-
	ory must be accessible by the contestants, who
	must not know the full name of the judging di-
	rectory.

	Only informal and formal contests have a contest
	directory.  Email contests do not.

	The contest directory itself and the symbolic
	link from the judging directory to the contest
	directory must be made by hand.

	The contents of the contest directory are made
	automatically by `makejudgingdir', with the
	exception of a few symbolic links to other
	directories and a few files (see `Contest Def-
	inition Data: The Contest Directory' below).

    help
        The help directory within the judging directory.
	This is not used during the contest proper, but
	is merely a staging area for the `this_contest'
	help file.  It contains the following files that
	are created by `makejudgingdir':

	    this_contest
	        The help file particular to the contest.

	    index
	        An index file to be input to `make-
		judgingdir' that lists all the index
		files output by that program and also
		lists the `this_contest' help file.

	The help directory and its contents are made
	automatically by `makejudgingdir', but then
	the person defining the contest must edit the
	`this_contest' file and re-run `makejudgingdir'.

    scoreboard.notes
        A file appended to the scoreboard by the `make-
	scoreboard' program when it emails the score-
	board to other locations for display on the web.
	This is normally used only for email contests.

    TODO
    	When `makejudgingdir' runs, it appends instruc-
	tions to its user to the end of this file.
	Typical instructions are `edit ./contest/secure/
	passwords' and `put the following lines in
	the judge's ~/.procmailrc file: ...'.

In addition to these files which are used by HPCM
programs, there is typically one other file that is not
used by HPCM programs themselves.  This is:

    Makefile
        The instructions to the UNIX `make' program so
	that running `make' in the judging directory
	will run `makejudgingdir' to build all the
	contest definition files.  The parameters to
	`makejudgingdir' are complex, and need to be
	kept in a file.  The Makefile may also do
	some of the things that this overview says
	must be done `by hand'.

	See hpcm/examples/*/Makefile for examples.


Contest Definition Data: The Contest Directory
------- ---------- ----- --- ------- ---------

Formal and informal contests have a contest directory
containing files that can be accessed by contestants.
Email contests do not have this directory.

Each contestant in a formal or informal contest has
an account in which `~/.hpcm_contest' is symbolically
linked to the contest directory.  The contest directory
itself has a+x permissions and contains the following
components that contestants can access.

    bin
    	A directory containing programs the contestants
	can execute.  The name `~/.hpcm_contest/bin' is
	part of the program search path for each contes-
	tant account.

	The name `bin' in the contest directory is
	usually symbolically linked to
	
	    ~/hpcm/contestant/bin

	in the judging directory.  Note that this means
	that ~/hpcm and ~/hpcm/contestant must have
	a+x permissions, ~/hpcm/contestant/bin must
	have a+rx permissions, and appropriate programs
	in the ~/hpcm/contestant/bin must have a+x or
	a+rx permissions.  Running `make' inside the
	~/hpcm directory, a part of the installation
	procedure of HPCM, sets these permissions.
	See `Installing HPCM' (hcpm/judge/doc/instal-
	ling_hpcm.doc).

	The `makejudgingdir' program symbolically links
	`bin' to `contestant/bin' in the contest direc-
	tory.  See `contestant' below.

    contestant
	The name `contestant' in the contest directory
	must be symbolically linked by hand to the
	hpcm/contestant directory, wherever that is
	located (usually ~/hpcm/contestant).

    demos
        This is a directory that contains demonstration
	problems.  It is strictly analogous to the
	`problems' directory, see below.

    help
    	This directory contains a+r copies of all the
	help files for the contestants.  These can be
	read by the contestant `help' program.

	This `help' directory and its contents are
	made automatically by `makejudgingdir'.  It is
	an exact copy of info/help (except that both
	contest/help and info/help do not exist for
	formal contests).

	The following are some special help files
	of note:

	    this_contest
	    	Information specific to the current
		contest.

	    index
	    	Index of all help files.

	    demos
	    	Index of demonstration problems.

	    problems
	    	Index of contest problems.

	One file, ./contest/help/problems, does not
	have a+r permissions when it is made, so that
	contestants in a formal contest cannot find
	out about the problems before the contest
	starts.  The `startcontest' program sets the
	permissions on this file to a+r.

    home
    	This is a symbolic link to a directory that is
	informally called the `contest/home' directory
	and that contains files shared among all con-
	testant accounts.  For example, in a contestant
	account the `.cshrc' name is symbolically linked
	to `.hpcm_contest/home/.cshrc', and thence to
	the `.cshrc' file in the contest/home directory.
	Therefore editing the `.cshrc' file within the
	contest/home directory changes that file in ALL
	contestant accounts.

	The contest/home directory is set up by the
	SETUP_PROTOTYPE program: see `Contest Definition
	Data: The Home Directory' below for more
	details.

    printer
    	This file contains nothing but the name of the
	printer to be used by the contestants.  This
	name should be suitable for use with the -P
	option to various UNIX print commands.  If the
	file is missing, these commands use the value
	of the PRINTER environment variable at the time
	the commands execute.

	This file is made by `makejudgingdir' and may
	be edited or removed by hand.

    printer_jobs
        If this file exists and is a+w, each use of the
	printer by one of the print commands in the
	contestant bin directory causes a line to be
	written into this file.  The line gives the
	time and the location of the contestant.  This
	location is taken from the who_where file (see
	below) `WHERE' field, if available, and is
	otherwise the contestant account name.

	This file can be used by the contestant `lpq'
	program to print out printer status, and by the
	judges to monitor printer activity.

	This file is made by `makejudgingdir' and can
	be removed or made o-w by hand.

    problems
    	This directory contains problem directories for
	each of the contest problems.  The strictly
	analogous `demos' directory (see above) contains
	demonstration problems.  These directories only
	exist for formal contests; for email and infor-
	mal contests, the same information (plus problem
	.txt files, see below) is put in info/problems
	and info/demos.

	Each non-demonstration problem directory in the
	contest directory is a subdirectory of this
	`problems' directory and has as its name the
	name of the problem.  Thus a problem named
	`pppp' would have `problems/pppp' as the name of
	its problem directory within the contest direc-
	tory.  Demonstration problems are similar but
	are in the `demos' directory instead of the
	`problems' directory.

	Within the problem directory there is an a+r
	copy of the `Makefile' of the problem.  It is
	also possible to put a a+r copy of the `.txt'
	file describing the problem, but this is NOT
	usually done for formal contests, as for these
	only paper printouts of .txt files are normally
	given to the contestants.  For demonstration
	problems (in `demos') many a+r file copies may
	be in the problem directory, as judge's input
	and output and solutions in different program-
	ming languages are often provided.

	For a formal contest, the contestant's hpcm_get
	program creates a problem directory in the con-
	testant's account and symbolically links into
	that directory all files in the problem direc-
	tory within the .hpcm/contest/problems direc-
	tory, i.e., the contest directory in the judge's
	account.  For an informal contest hpcm_get ob-
	tains the same information from the `info/
	problems' directory by email and makes a copy of
	the files in the contestant account.

	This `problems' directory (unlike the `demos'
	directory) does not have a+rx permissions when
	it is made, so that contestants in a formal
	contest cannot find out about the problems
	before the contest starts.  The `startcontest'
	program sets the permissions on this directory
	to a+rx.

	This `problems' directory and its contents are
	made automatically by `makejudgingdir'.  This
	contest/problems directory is an exact copy for
	formal contests of what goes into info/problems
	for informal and email contests, except that
	contest/problems does not have .txt files (un-
	less the makejudgingdir -txt option is used).

	The `demos' directory is similarly made and is
	an exact copy of what would go into info/demos.

    scoreboard.1head
    scoreboard.2
    scoreboard.3
    scoreboard.4
        The scoreboard, which can be read by the contes-
	tant `scoreboard' program, can have up to four
	pages, which are stored in the a+r files
	scoreboard.1 through scoreboard.4.  The first of
	these files is made automatically by the `make-
	scoreboard' program, which concatenates the
	scoreboard.1head file to the computed score-
	board.  The scoreboard.1head, scoreboard.2,
	scoreboard.3, and scoreboard.4 files must be
	edited by hand.  See the documentation of
	`makescoreboard' and `hpcm/contestant/bin/
	scoreboard' for details.

    secure
    	This directory contains files that cannot be
	accessed by contestants, but can be accessed by
	the judging account, and can be accessed by the
	hpcm_sendmail program which can be run by
	contestants but sets its user id (by the UNIX
	setuid mechanism) to the judging account.
	
	This directory, if it does not already exist,
	will be made by the `makejudgingdir' program,
	as will some of the files in the directory.

	    hpcm_sendmail.rc
	        This file contains parameters for hpcm_
		sendmail.  Specifically, the email
		address to send mail to in order to
		contact the judge (this email address
		typically contains a password), and the
		key-name and key to use in signing the
		email (or more specifically, the HPCM
		return email address and date fields of
		the email).  An example hpcm_sendmail.rc
		file is:

		    To: 13cc299bd7<walton@walton1>
		    Key: 55071403c7
		    Key-Name: judging_informal

		Note that the password in the `To:' ad-
		dress is not secure from the contestant,
		as it appears in the contestant's CC
		copy of the email that the contestant
		sends to the judge.  It does prevent
		complete outsiders from `crashing the
		party', however.

		This file is made by the makejudgingdir
		program, which creates random passwords
		for the email address and key.

	    passwords
	    	This file lists the contestant accounts,
		and is used to create these accounts.
		Each line of this file has the format:

		    account:password:who:C:T:comment

	        where C is the coach's email address and
		and T is the team's email address.  The
		first field is the contestant account
		name.  The `who' field is the team name
		in descriptive form.

		The password field can be generated by
		the makejudgingdir program.  The rest
		of the file must be made by hand.

		Only the account and password fields are
		needed by HPCM to run a contest.

		Note that in making up a list of contes-
		tant accounts, you should include one
		test account, which you can use to see
		if everything is working.  However, you
		should NOT include the prototype account
		in which SETUP_PROTOTYPE is run.

	    passwords_header
	        This is a file used by hpcm_print_pass-
		words.  This program prints each account
		name and password on a separate page
		with the contents of this file at the
		beginning of the page.  It is used only
		when account names and passwords are to
		be handed to contestants: typically this
		is only in an informal contest.

    who_where
        This file is a copy of the secure/passwords file
	but with the password field value replaced by
	a `WHERE' value, that tells where the team is
	physically located.  This file is used by the
	print programs: the where field labels the pages
	of print output and the line output to any
	print_jobs file.  If the who_where file is
	missing, not a+r, or the `WHERE' field has not
	been filled in by hand, the print programs use
	the contestant account name instead.

	The who_where file is made automatically from
	the secure/passwords file by makejudgingdir,
	and will be updated automatically by that
	program when the secure/passwords file changes.
	However, the `WHERE' field in the who_where
	file must then be filled in by hand.

    trashable
        This file lists all contestant accounts that
	can be `trashed'.  To `trash' an account is
	to remove all its files and then reload its
	files from ./hpcm_contest/home/setup.tar, which
	is just the files in the prototype contestant
	account.  See the documentation of the SETUP_
	PROTOTYPE program and see `Contest Definition
	Data: The Home Directory' below.

	The `trashable' file is made from secure/
	passwords by the `makejudgingdir -trashable'
	command.  It is just the list of all accounts in
	secure/passwords. It should only be made just
	before trashing the contestant accounts, and
	should be removed immediately after trashing
	these accounts.  There is a program runnable by
	a contestant account, TRASH_ACCOUNT, that will
	trash the contestant account, but only if the
	name of that account is listed in an a+r
	.hpcm_contest/trashable file.


Contest Definition Data: The Home Directory
------- ---------- ----- --- ---- ---------

Each contestant account must be initialized identically
before the start of a contest.  This is done with the
help of some maintainence programs using a special di-
rectory which is called, informally, the `contest/home'
directory.

To initialize a contestant account, a program called
TRASH_ACCOUNT is run.  This first removes all files
and directories from the account.  It then loads a
completely new set of files and directories from the
`setup.tar' file in the `contest/home' directory.

However, what if something needs changing during the
contest?  As an aid to making this easier, each con-
testant account is set up so that most of the files and
directories in the account's home directory are symbol-
ic links to a real file or directory within the
`contest/home' directory.  Then changing the real file
or directory changes the file or directory for all the
contestant accounts at once.  Of course the real file
or directory must have a+r and maybe a+x permissions,
and cannot be writable by its users, the contestants.

There are a few files and directories which, for
security reasons, cannot be shared among contestants,
because the programs that use them insist they be
owned by the account running the program.  Examples
are the `.procmailrc' file which is used to automa-
tically extract files from the responses to hpcm_
get in an informal contest, and the `.ssh' directory
which can optionally be used to make it easy for
the judge to log into any contestant account.

The `contest/home' directory is set up and maintained
by the SETUP_PROTOTYPE program.  To use SETUP_PROTOTYPE,
a prototype account must be created, and it is the files
and symbolic links in this account that are saved and
then restored in all the contestant accounts.

There are several special files in the `contest/home'
directory.

    setup.tar
        The tar file that contains all the files
	and symbolic links which are to be in a
	contestant account after TRASH_ACCOUNT is
	run (except for .hpcm_contest: see below).
	It is made by SETUP_PROTOTYPE by tar'ing
	all the files and symbolic links in the
	prototype account.

    setup.ls
        The output of `ls -aR' run just after files
	have been restored from setup.tar.  Used to
	check for a valid restoration.  This is made
	by SETUP_PROTOTYPE.

    empty.ls
       The output of `ls -a' run just after all files
       have been deleted by TRASH_ACCOUNT, and before
       restoring files from setup.tar.  Used to check
       for valid file removal.  This is made by SETUP_
       PROTOTYPE.

There is one symbolic link that TRASH_ACCOUNT does not
set using setup.tar.  This is the .hpcm_contest symbolic
link to the contest directory.  As a consequence, the
.hpcm_contest of a contestant account may not the same
as the .hpcm_contest of the prototype account, and
therefore one `contest/home' directory may be used by
many different contests, each of which symbolically
link their `home' subdirectory to the same `contest/
home' directory.

The `contest/home' directory is made and maintained by
the SETUP_PROTOTYPE program: see the documentation of
that program for details.  Also see the documentation
of the TRASH_ACCOUNT program.


Contest Definition Data: Contestant Accounts
------- ---------- ----- ---------- --------

After making the following:

    ~JJJ			The judging account.

    ~JJJ/contest_cccc		A contest directory.

    ~JJJ/prototype_home		The `contest/home'
    				directory made by
				SETUP_PROTOTYPE.

    ~JJJ/contest_cccc/home	A symbolic link to
    				~JJJ/prototype_home.

    ~JJJ/contest_cccc/secure/passwords
    				The file listing all
				the contestant
				accounts and their
				passwords.

    ~JJJ/contest_cccc/secure/trashable
    				A list of the accounts
				for which TRASH_
				ACCOUNT will work:
				see above.

it is possible to make all the contestant accounts
very easily by logging in as root and running:

 	cd ~JJJ/hpcm/secure/bin
 	./hpcm_make_accounts ~JJJ/contest_cccc
 	./hpcm_set_passwords ~JJJ/contest_cccc
 	./hpcm_TRASH_ACCOUNTS ~JJJ/contest_cccc

The first of three programs run here makes the accounts
listed in secure/passwords, the second sets the pass-
words of these accounts, and the third runs TRASH_
ACCOUNT in each of these accounts.  Note that only con-
testant accounts, and NOT the prototype account, should
be listed in secure/passwords.

Most of the files that are in a contestant account are
just those provided by the UNIX operating system to
every newly created account.  However the following
files need special attention:

    .cshrc (or other shell initialization file)
    	The `path' must be modified to include
	`.hpcm_contest/bin'.  If special compilers
	or interpreters are being used, the path
	should also include these.  It may be desirable
	to turn off autologout (unset this variable in
	.cshrc), especially in a formal contest in
	which the judge's log the contestants in.
	Also `alias ll -lL' is desireable in a formal
	contest, as the symbolic links to problem
	files may be confusing to the contestants.

    .procmailrc
        For an informal contest, this must include stuff
	to extract files from responses to hcpm_get.
	See hpcm/examples/informal/Makefile and
	hpcm/examples/informal/procmailrc.  This file
	must be owned by the account in whose home dir-
	ectory it appears, or else it will not be used
	for security reasons.  Therefore it cannot be
	shared among contestant accounts, and is not
	symbolically linked in these accounts (there is
	a separate copy in each contestant account).

    .ssh/authorized_keys
        Creating this file correctly can enable the
	judge to log into each contestant account with-
	out using the account's password.  Like the
	.procmailrc file, the .ssh directory and its
	contents cannot be shared among contestant
	accounts, and there must be a separate copy in
	each contestant account.


Contest Definition Data: Auxilary Files
------- ---------- ----- -------- -----

There is one file in the judging account that is shared
among all the contests supported by the account:

    ~/.procmailrc
    	When the makejudgingdir program creates the
	contest/secure/hpcm_sendmail.rc file, it
	writes into the TODO file some lines that must
	be copied by hand to the ~/.procmailrc file.
	These lines write email submissions sent to the
	contest to the correct judging directory.

	For example, if the hpcm_sendmail.rc file
	contains the line:

	    To: 13cc299bd7<JJJ@judge's-computer>

	then the .procmailrc file should contain

	    :0
	    * ^To:.*13cc299bd7
	    | receivemail judging_cccc_ppppppppppp | \\
	      dispatchmail judging_cccc_ppppppppppp

	where ~/judging_cccc_ppppppppppp is the judg-
	ing directory for the contest in the judging
	account JJJ.


Contest Definition Data: Security
------- ---------- ----- --------

HPCM has the following security goals:

1. Prevent a foreign account from pretending to be
   a contestant account.  This is only possible
   for informal and formal contests (but not for
   email contests).

   This is done in a formal and informal contest by
   having the hpcm_sendmail program which is used by
   the contestants to send mail to the judge be a
   privileged program with access to information not
   available to contestants, and by having that
   program add information and a signature for that
   information to the email sent.

   Specifically, hpcm_sendmail is a UNIX set-user-id
   program that sets the ID to the judging account,
   so it can see the .hpcm_contest/secure/hpcm_
   sendmail.rc file, even though the contestant
   accounts cannot.  This hpcm_sendmail.rc file
   contains a key name and key.  The hpcm_sendmail
   program adds three header fields to the mail it
   sends:

   	X-HPCM-Reply-To
	    The email address HPCM uses as the
	    identity of the account sending the
	    email, and therefore as the identity
	    of the contestant.
	X-HPCM-Date
	    The time the email is sent, which HPCM
	    uses as the time of submission.
	X-HPCM-Signature
	    A signature of the two fields just given,
	    made using the key name and key.

    Upon receipt the signature is verified by the
    judging software, and unverifyable email is
    rejected.

    More specifically, HPCM programs do the following.
    First, they use X-HPCM-Data and X-HPCM-Reply-To
    in preference to the normal mail Date and Reply-To
    header fields.  Second, when the email is first
    processed by `receivemail', any X-HPCM-Signature-OK
    header field in the received mail is stripped from
    the incoming message, and this field is recomputed
    from the two header fields just mentioned and the
    X-HPCM-Signature header field.  The recomputed
    X-HPCM-Signature-OK field is stored in the message
    $received_file file for use by subsequent process-
    ing.  Recomputation and use of X-HPCM-Signature-OK
    may be surpressed by setting the `use-authentica-
    tion' global variable to false.

2. Prevent code written by contestants from corrupting
   the files of the judge.

   This is done by running the programs submitted by
   the contestant in a `sandbox'.

   The sandbox consists of changing the user and group
   (both real and effective) of the process executing
   the contestant program to `sandbox'.  This must be
   a defined account name that should not be able to
   access any files or directories except those public-
   ally available.

   The sandbox is implemented by the judge's hpcm_
   sandbox program, which must be installed in the UNIX
   /usr/sbin directory (or equivalent), and is set to
   do a root set-user-id.  The contestant's hpcm_sandbox
   program is the same binary, but in the hpcm/
   contestant/bin directory, and without any set-user-id
   capability.

   However, current JAVA implementations seem to have
   the following security flaw: they convert relative
   .class file names to absolute names before using
   them.  As a consequence, all the directories in
   the path from the root to the directory in which a
   contestant's JAVA submission is being run must have
   a+x permissions because the contestant's submission
   is run by the `sandbox' account.  The .class files
   themselves must have a+r permissions.

   However, this last difficulty does not permit contes-
   tant code to write any files or directories in the
   judging account.

3. Prevent code written by the contestants from
   exporting judges information, including solutions
   of the judge and other contestants, into the
   outside world.  This goal is met with some defects.

   It is not practical to make it impossible for
   contestant programs to write information to the
   outside world.  A contestant can merely open a
   file in the contestant's account's home directory,
   after leaving that directory a+w, for example.
   Or the contestant can exploit /tmp, or open a
   network connection.

   The `sandbox' previously described prevents
   contestant programs from being able to read most
   files and all directories in the judging account.
   However, because of the problem with JAVA mentioned
   above, a contestant's account can discover the names
   of components of some directories by guessing names
   and looking at the error codes returned.  Given an-
   other contestant, and guessing submission times, one
   contestant's program can read another contestant's
   .class files.

   A contestant program can always read the judge's
   input, since that is provided to the program
   during judging.

   However, any contestant program that sends informa-
   tion to the outside world will itself be captured
   and held in the judging account, serving as damning
   evidence if the foul nature of the program is dis-
   covered.  Thus any contestant who wrote such a pro-
   gram would be risking discovery for a very long time,
   up until the judge's decide to discard information
   collected during the contest.


Contest Raw Data: Directories
------- --- ----- -----------

The raw data of the contest consists of submissions and
requests and the results of processing these.  Each
submission or request is an email message that is placed
in a separate directory by itself.  The system then
works in that directory to develop information, such
as the binary program created by compiling a submission,
the output of running this program on the judge's input
data, and score automatically assigned to the submis-
sion, and any score later manually assigned to the sub-
mission.  All of this information is considered to be
`raw data'.

In general, contest raw data is only created and never
destroyed.  Thus it provides both information about the
state of the contest and an audit trail telling what
happened during the contest.

Raw data is stored in the following directories:

    mail_directory
        Normally the `mail' subdirectory of the judging
	directory.

	The mail_directory contains a separate subdirec-
	tory for each piece of email sent to the judge.

	The mail_directory is created by `makejudging-
	dir' and must exist before judge's email is
	received.

    mail_directory/dddd-<<ssssss>>-submission
        This is a directory holding an email sent to the
	judge by the submitter ssssss at a time indica-
	ted by the date dddd.  A specific example of the
	last name component of the directory is:

	2000-12-10-06:30:49-<<hpcm-t@method>>-submission

	The submitter is normally the return email
	address of the email message sent to the judge,
	but may be editted to remove spaces and alter
	some special characters.  It is not used per se
	as an email address by HPCM.  The part before
	any `@' may be used as a contestant name by
	the scoreboard software.

	Note that the date gives a time in seconds, and
	is organized so that submissions with later
	times sort alphanumerically later.

	Because the date is in seconds, there cannot be
	more than one submission per second from the
	same submitter.  Any submission but the first
	will find that the directory it is supposed to
	create already exists, and therefore all submis-
	sions but the first with the same date will be
	ignored.

	As a consequence, programs like hpcm_get that
	send email to the judge pause for at least a
	second after sending each separate piece of
	email.

	More details about the files in this directory
	are given in following sections.

    log_directory
        Normally the `log' subdirectory of the judging
	directory.

        Errors that are not particular to one submission
	or request are placed here, each in their own
	file with the same name structure (including
	`checking') as errors put in submission direc-
	tories.

	The log_directory is created automatically when
	it is first needed.

    ~/HPCM_Error_Log
        This is an emergency error log directory for
	use only if the log_directory cannot be found,
	cannot be created, or is not writable.

	This directory is created automatically when it
	is first needed.


Contest Raw Data: Submissions
------- --- ----- -----------

Any email sent to the judge is called a `submission'.
There are three kinds of submission: email containing a
problem solution, which is called a `solution submis-
sion'; email requesting files to be returned to a
contestant, which is called a `get request', and email
asking a question, which is called a `query'.

Each email sent to the judge is placed in a separate
subdirectory of the mail_directory.  This subdirectory
has a name of the form:

    mail_directory/dddd-<<ssssss>>-submission

Files in the email's *-submission directory that are
specific to each kind of email are described in separate
sections below.  Files that can exist in all kinds of
*-submission directories are as follows:

    $received_file
	This is a read-only file that holds the piece of
	email sent to the judge which caused this direc-
	tory to be created.

    $reply_file
	This is the final reply email sent by the judge
	concerning this directory.  Thus the presence of
	this file indicates that the judge is done with
	this *-submission directory.

	The judge can also send non-final email replies,
	which are NOT stored in this file.

    $no_reply_file
	This file is created by the judge to indicate
	the judge is done with this *-submission direc-
	tory, but does not intend to send an email reply
	to the contestant.  Typically this\
					$no_reply_file
	file is just a one line file containing a reason
	why the judge feels no email reply is needed.
	The `lookat' program can revisit directories
	containing a $no_reply_file file whose contents
	match some given regular expression; so the
	contents of this file can serve as a marker to
	find this directory later.

	When the judge is done with this directory,
	either the $reply_file file or $no_reply_file
	file must exist.

    $reply_history_file
	This file is a log of ALL email replies sent by
	the judge for this directory.

    dddd-rrrr-<<ppppp>>-unchecked-error
	This `error log' file describes a system error
	that occurred processing this directory.  Of
	course, system errors are not supposed to hap-
	pen, but if they do, this file containing all
	the available information about the error is
	created.

	dddd is the date in seconds, rrrr is a random
	number to make the file unique even if several
	system errors happen in the same second, ppppp
	is the name of the program that sufferred the
	system error.

    dddd-rrrr-<<ppppp>>-checked-error
	This is an `unchecked-error' file (see just
	above) which has been read and `checked' by the
	judge.  An error file is `checked' by changing
	the `unchecked' in its name to `checked'.

	The `tracker' program searches for unchecked
	error log files and calls the judge's attention
	to them.  Checked error log files are ignored by
	`tracker'.

    dddd-rrrr-<<ppppp>>-unchecked-error.mail
    dddd-rrrr-<<ppppp>>-checked-error.mail
	An error log file may be emailed to a `log_
	manager' when it is created.  If this is done, a
	companion .mail file is created containing the
	email message.  This file is `checked' when its
	associated error log file is `checked'.

Contest Raw Data: Solution Submissions
------- --- ----- -------- -----------

A solution submission is an email with a subject of the
form `submit pppp.eee', where pppp.eee is a file name.
The email body contains the named file.  The email is
interpreted as submission of a single file that is a
solution of the problem named `pppp'.

The file being submitted may appear in the body of the
email in either of two ways.  It may be `formatted' or
`unformatted'.  If formatted, it appears as:

	HPCM_BEGIN pppp.eee
	.. first line of file
	.. next line of file
	.. rest of file, each line preceded by ..
	HPCM_END pppp.eee

If unformatted the file is just the body of the email
message, verbatim.

Only formatted submissions are usually allowed in
informal and formal contests.  Unformatted submissions
are typically allowed in email contests so that
contestants who do not have program support (hpcm_
submit) can submit easily.

A solution submission directory is processed by the
`autojudge' program.  This produces the following files
in order (see `Library Data: Problems' above for more
details about these files):

    pppp.eee		The submitted file.
    pppp.in		Judge's input.
    $make_file		Problem Makefile.
    pppp.test		Judge's output.
    $scoring_instructions_file
			Optional scoring instructions.
    pppp		Binary program.
    pppp.cerr		Compiler error output.
    pppp.out		Solution standard output.
    pppp.err		Solution error output.
    core		Possible core dump.
    $auto_score_file		Autojudge score.
    $reply_file		Possible final reply.
    $reply_history_file	History of all replies.


If an error happens during the process or producing
these files, the process stops.  An error in extracting
pppp.eee, or an error in the name of the file (pppp is
not a problem in the solutions directory or eee is not
a legal extension), generates a $reply_file file that is
the final say in the error.  Other errors generate
$auto_score_file files.  If the scoring mode is `auto',
this is the final say and a $reply_file file is also
generated.  If the scoring mode is `auto+manual', the
contents of $auto_score_file are sent to the contestant
but not as a final score.  If the scoring mode is
`manual', no email is sent to the contestant.

If there is no error, the $auto_score_file is `Complete-
ly Correct', this score is final, it is sent to the con-
testant, and a $reply_file file is created.

The behavior of `autojudge' is similar to the behavior
of `make' in a contestant's problem directory (see help
files) or a problem library problem directory (see
above).  The main differences are that the `autojudge'
extracts the `pppp.eee' file, captures compiler errors
in `pppp.cerr', and captures run errors in `pppp.err'.

The section `Contest Raw Data: Data Flow' below gives
some more details for solution submission directories.


If the `autojudge' does not produces a final reply, it
creates a $needs_reply_flag_file file in the flag dir-
ectory to signal that this directories needs the atten-
tions of `manualreply'.  The `manualreply' program must
then be run to assign a manual score, which is stored in
a `$manual_score_file' file.   Email containing this
score is sent to the contestant as a final reply and is
stored in the $reply_mail file.


Contest Raw Data: Get Requests
------- --- ----- --- --------

A get request submission is an email with a subject of
the form `get filename ...'.  The filenames are relative
to the judging directory's `info' subdirectory, and name
files to be `gotten', i.e., returned in reply mail to
the contestant.  A directory can also be named, in which
case all the files and the subdirectories in the dir-
ectory will be gotten, recursively.  See the documen-
tation of the `autoinfo' program, which processes get
requests, for details.

The `autoinfo' program produces the following files in
the email's *-submission directory:

    $reply_file		Final reply.
    $reply_history_file	History of all replies.
    $gotten_file	List of files successfully
    			gotten.

The `autoinfo' program always produces a final replay
the therefore a $reply_file file.  It may produce two
email replies: one containing error messages and one
containing files successfully gotten.  These two kinds
of replies have different `Subject' header field formats
so they can be distinguished by automatic mail routers
such as `procmail', and replies containing files can be
sent to hpcm_extract, while replies containing error
messages can avoid hpcm_extract.

Processing of get requests is completely automatic;
there is never any need for manual reply (baring a sys-
tem error, of course).

Contest Raw Data: Queries
------- --- ----- -------

A query submission is an email with a subject that does
not begin with either `submit' or `get'.  Such an email
is used to ask a question of the judge.

If the `reply_mode' is `auto', the `dispatchmail' pro-
gram produces an email reply and a $reply_file file
automatically.  If the `reply_manager' is not \"\", this
email is CC'ed to the `reply_manager' who can respond
from an account other than the judge's.

If the `reply_mode' is not `auto', the\
				$needs_reply_flag_file
file is created in the flag directory to signal that
this directories needs the attentions of `manualreply'.
The `manualreply' program must then be run to generate
a $reply_file or a $no_reply_file file.

       $reply_file

If a system error occurs at any point, which can only
happen if HPCM has a bug, then processing stops and
an unchecked error log file is created.  If processing
is within a *-submission directory, the log file is
created within this directory; otherwise the log file
is created within the log_directory.

Contest Derived Data: Procssing Status Files
------- ------- ----- --------- ------ -----

During the processing of raw data and the updating of
the scoreboard, several files are used to keep track of
the status of data processing and program processes.
These files and some of their containing directories
are:

    flag_directory
        Normally the `flag' subdirectory of the judging
	directory.

        Flag files in this directory are created just
	after information is written into other files
	that may need to be read by certain programs
	(makescoreboard or tacker).   The programs that
	read these other files, when the see that a flag
	file exists, delete the flag file first, and
	then read the other files to see what to do.
	Thus these reader programs know that if the
	flag files do NOT exist, nothing has changed
	since the last time they read files.

	Specifically, the following are flag files in
	the flag directory:

	    $score_flag_file
	        Created when any $auto_score_file or
		$manual_score_file file is written;  the
		`makescoreboard' program sees this flag
		and recomputes the scoreboard.

	    $needs_reply_flag_file
	        Created when any action that will re-
		quire a person to use the `manualreply'
		program happens.  The `tracker' program
		sees this flag and then looks throughout
		the contest directories and files to see
		where `manualreply' should be run.

    $scoreboard_pid_file
        A file in the judging directory containing the
	process ID of any `makescoreboard' program that
	is running in background.  This file is main-
	tained by the `makescoreboard' program with its
	`-start' and `-stop' options.  The `-status'
	option reads this file and displays the status
	of the process identified in the file.

    mail_directory/*-submission/$dispatch_pid_file
        This file is used as a lock to prevent more than
	one `autojudge' or `manualreply' program from
	running in a submission subdirectory at once.
	This file is a lock on the *-submission direc-
	tory.  The file contains the process ID of the
	program that has locked the directory.

	If `autojudge' tries to create this file and
	the file already exists, `autojudge' terminates
	without error, assuming some other process is
	processing the directory.  If `manualreply'
	tries to create this file and the file already
	exiss, `manualreply' displays the status of the
	process identified by this file, and asks its
	user whether to quit or kill the identified
	process (if it is still running) and continue.

Contest Derived Data: Scoreboard Files
------- ------- ----- ---------- -----

The `makescoreboard' program can run in background and
recompute the scoreboard as necessary.  It computes
one or both of two files.

    scoreboard.mail
        A copy of the scoreboard emailed to an address
	by `makescoreboard'.

    ./contest/scoreboard.1
        The first of four scoreboard pages visible to
	the contestant `scoreboard' display program.

See `makescoreboard' for details.

Programs: Contestant
--------- ----------

The programs runnable by the contestant are documented
in the help files: see `Library Data: Help Documenta-
tion'.  All these programs are in the hpcm/contestant/
bin directory, to which the contestant account's .hpcm_
contest/bin directory is linked.  A quick summary of
these programs follows:

    help		Display help files.
    scoreboard		Display scoreboard.
    xcsh		Create new xterm windows.

    hpcm_sendmail	Send email from a contestant
    			to the judge.
    hpcm_get		Make file get requests using
    			hpcm_sendmail or link
    			problem files into contestant
			account directories.
    hpcm_extract	Extract files returned in
    			email by get requests.
    hpcm_sandbox	Run contestant submissions
    			in a sandbox.
    hpcm_submit		Submit a problem solution
    			file using hpcm_sendmail.

    fprint		Print 56 column files.
    print		Print 80 column files.
    print2		Print 80 column files 2 file
    			pages per print page.
    lpq			Display printer status.


Programs: Judging
--------- -------

The judge's programs are in hpcm/judge/bin, which is
placed in the PATH of the judge's account.  A quick
summary of the programs used during a contest to run
the contest follows:

    receivemail		Process received email and store
    			it in a *-submission directory.
    dispatchmail	Call autodispatch for each
    			*-submission directory.
    autodispatch	Call autoinfo or autojudge or
    			process query, for a *-submis-
			sion directory.

    autoinfo		Process a get request *-submis-
    			sion directory.
    autojudge		Process a solution submit *-
    			submission directory.

    extractmail		Extract a solution program file
    			from received email.
    hpcm_sandbox	Run hpcm_sandbox_x with the
    			`-core 0' option.
    hpcm_sandbox_x	Run a program in a sandbox.
    			Same as contestant/bin/hpcm_
			sandbox but with root set user
			ID.
    autoscore		Compute the score from the .out
    			and .test files.
    scorediff		Compare the .out and .test files
    			and report types of differences.

    startcontest	Change the mode of ./contest/
    			problems and ./contest/help/pro-
			blems to make them readable by
			contestants.

    makescoreboard	Recompute the scoreboard files
    			at intervals.
    scoreboard		Compute a scoreboard given the
    			output of `scorefinder'.
    scorefinder		Look through all the *-submis-
    			sion directories for score
			files and output a summary of
			all the information found.

    manualreply		Permit a human user (the judge)
    			to inspect the contents of a
			*-submission (or error log) dir-
			ectory and to specify manual
			scores and email replies.
    tracker		Identify *-submission director-
    			ies for which `manualreply'
			should be run and permit a user
			to dispatch `manualreply' to
			these.
    trackfinder		Look through all the *-submis-
    			sion directories for information
			needed by `tracker' and output
			this information for `tracker'
			to use.
    reply		An older simpler version of
    			`tracker'.
    lookat		Find *-submission directories
    			containing a file with a given
			name and contents, and dispatch
			`manualreply' to these director-
			ies.

Note that some of these programs are imported by the
hcpm/judge/bin/Makefile from other directories.  E.g.,
hpcm_sandbox_x is a compiled version of hpcm/secure/
src/hpcm_sandbox.c that is normally installed in /sbin.
