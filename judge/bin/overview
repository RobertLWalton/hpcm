---- ------- --------

Creating a Contest
-------- - -------

To create a contest, first read the help files


	hpcm/contestant/help/*/*

to get a good idea of what you are creating.  Choose
the type of contest you want to create (email, informal,
formal) and then read the instructions in

	hpcm/examples/<contest-type>_contest/Makefile

This file also contains basic advice on how to judge
the contest.

You should also read

	hpcm/judge/lib/hpcm_judging.rc

and try to understand the parameters in that file as
best you can.

In order to better understand what you are doing, you
should read the following overview and then read the
individual program documentation for some of the pro-
grams used to set up or judge contests.
