HPCM Judge's Overview
---- ------- --------

The Harvard Programming Contest Manager, HPCM, has the
following features:

    o Supports different kinds of programming contests:

    	email	    Contestants supply their own ac-
		    counts and communicate with the
		    judge by email to get problems and
		    submit solutions.  Contestants may
		    compete at any time.

	informal    Contestants are given accounts which
		    they can use locally or remotely at
		    any time to get problems and submit
		    solutions.

	formal	    Contestants are given accounts and
		    printouts of problems at a fixed
		    contest starting time.

    o Has an automatic judge, that can be used exclu-
      sively, or as an aid to a human judge.

    o Has a library of problems and supports easy semi-
      automated creation of new contests.

    o Keeps a complete log of everything that happens
      during contests in the form of files that can be
      easily analyzed for different purposes.

    o Is written modularly in TCL and Bourne Shell (sh)
      so that HPCM can easily be adapted and modified.


Creating a Contest
-------- - -------

To create a contest, first read the help files


	hpcm/contestant/help/*/*

to get a good idea of what you are creating.  Choose
the type of contest you want to create (email, informal,
formal) and then read the instructions in

	hpcm/examples/<contest-type>_contest/Makefile

This file also contains basic advice on how to judge
the contest.

You should also read

	hpcm/judge/lib/hpcm_judging.rc

and try to understand the parameters in that file as
best you can.

In order to better understand what you are doing, you
should read the following overview and then read the
individual program documentation for some of the pro-
grams used to set up or judge contests.


Data and Programs
---- --- --------

HPCM handles different categories of data:

Library Data
    Problem descriptions, help documentation files,
    example contest parameter files.

Contest Definition Data
    Files that define a contest, including documentation
    for contestants, problem definition, solution defi-
    nition, and contest parameter definition.

Contest Raw Data
    Files that capture submissions and information gen-
    erated during judging, such as binary program files,
    output files, scores, and email replies.

Contest Derived Data
    Scoreboards and contest tracking summaries.


HPCM also contains several different categories of
programs:

Contestant Programs
    Programs run by contestants during a contest.

Judging Programs
    Programs run to judge a contest.

Contest Making Programs
    Programs run to make a contest.

Maintenance Programs
    Programs run to maintain the library or test the
    HPCM system.
