set lib_directory "[file dirname $argv0]/../lib"
source $lib_directory/judging_common.tcl
set log_globally yes
catch {

set document "
dispatchmail \[directory\]

    If the directory argument is given, this program
    makes that directory current before searching for
    the `$judging_parameters_file' file or doing
    anything else.

    This program then reads subdirectory names, one per
    line, from the standard input.  Treating each as the
    name of a subdirectory of the mail directory, this
    program calls `autodispatch' for each subdirectory.

    This program outputs each subdirectory name just
    before it calls autodispatch for the subdirectory."


# If any arguments left, print documentation and exit.
