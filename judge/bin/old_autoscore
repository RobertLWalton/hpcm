cd submission_directory; autoscore program_name

    Given the submission directory as the current dir-
    ectory, given the program name (e.g. pppp), and
    given the output file (pppp.out), optional error
    file (pppp.err), and test file (pppp.test, the
    judge's solution's version of the output file),
    computes the `$auto_score_file' file in the
    submission directory, using purely automatic
    (non-manual means).

    If the error file (pppp.err) exists and is non-
    empty, the score is one of:

    	Cpu Time Limit Exceeded
	Output Size Limit Exceeded
	Program Crashed

    depending upon whether a line of the error file
    matches a regular expression indicating there
    was a cpu time or output size problem.  Currently
    it is not possible to discriminate memory limit
    exceedments from other memory errors, and they
    are all classed as `Program Crashed'.

    If the error file does not exist or is empty, but
    the output file does not exist, the score is:

	Program Crashed

    If the error file does not exist or is empty, and
    the output file exists, the program is scored by
    comparing the output of

    	scorediff output_file test_file

    to the whitespace separated items of the first line
    of any
    
	$instructions_file

    file in the submission directory.  If this last
    file is missing, the items default to:

    	$scoring_instructions_default

    The possible $instructions_file items are:

    	whitespace	Allow matching whitespace in
			the two files to be not exactly
			the same.  However, by itself
			this item does not permit
			different numbers of `\\n's.

	linebreak	Allow one file to have line
			breaks where the other file
			does not.  Only effective if
			whitespace or spacebreak is
			allowed.

	spacebreak	Allow one file to have white-
			space where the other file has
			none.  However, by itself this
			item does not permit one file
			to have `\\n's where there
			other file has no whitespace.

	number D	Allow the two files to have
			matching numbers whose absolute
			difference is as much as D,
			where D is a floating point
			value.

    The possible scores (with empty error file and
    extant output file) are:

    	Completely Correct
	Formatting Error
	Incomplete Output
	Incorrect Output

    If scorediff reports `nonblank' or `eof2' (output
    has non-whitespace after test file ends), or if
    scorediff reports a `number' difference greater than
    allowed by the ${instructions_file}, the
    output is incorrect.  Otherwise, if scorediff
    reports something other than `eof1' that is not
    allowed by ${instructions_file}, the output
    has a formatting error.  Otherwise if scorediff
    reports `eof1' the output is incomplete.  Otherwise
    the output is correct.

    The score is written to the `$auto_score_file' file
    in the submission directory and is also written as a
    single line to the standard output."
