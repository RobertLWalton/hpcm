		     Installing HPCM
		     ---------- ----


Information about HPCM
----------- ----- ----

The web page for HPCM is:

	www.deas.harvard.edu/~hc3/hpcm

There is an overview of HPCM that tells what the system
does.


Requirements
------------

HPCM currently requires a UNIX system with Bourne shell
and TCL language interpreters.

A couple of programs require the `read -r' Bourne
shell command, and a Bourne shell `echo' command that
does not specially interpret the `\\' character.  If you
are using a UNIX system whose Bourne shell does not
support these features, the simplest fix is to import
the GNU Bourne shell, bash, and fix the programs con-
taining `read -r' to use it (these programs are current-
ly hpcm_extract and SET_PROTOTYPE).

TCL can be obtained at:	 	www.scriptics.com

Bash can be obtained at:

	www.gnu.org/software/bash/bash.html


Installation of HPCM
------------ -- ----

1. Import the HPCM system into ~/hpcm.  This can be
   done by untaring the hpcm.tar file while the
   current directory is ~.  It is also possible to
   put the hpcm system elsewhere.  The example
   contests assume HPCM is installed in ~/hpcm,
   but they can be modified if HPCM is installed
   elsewhere.

2. Assuming /sbin is the right directory for secure
   root setuid programs, run:

		cd ~/hpcm/secure/src
		su
		make root_install
		exit

   This installs the hpcm_sandbox program as a setuid
   root program in the system /sbin directory, which
   is the appropriate thing for Linux.  If you put
   this setuid binary in another place, say `/foo',
   you should replace the `make' command above by

		make SECURE_BIN=/foo root_install

   If you skip this step, an insecure hpcm_sandbox
   will be installed (in the next step) for the
   judge, which will mean that malicious contestant
   programs could corrupt the judging files.

3. Run		cd ~/hpcm
		make

   This sets some file modes, makes a few binary files,
   and makes the judge's documentation files in hpcm/
   judge/doc.

4. Put ~/hcpm/judge/bin in the PATH of the current
   (judge's) account.  Do NOT put ~/hpcm/contestant/
   bin in that PATH."
