printer_server QUEUE-DIRECTORY

    Act as a server for printer_client: see that program
    for user documentation.

    This program is intended to be invoked from an
    .ssh/authorized_keys file line of the form:

        command=\"printer_server QUEUE-DIRECTORY\" ...

    The QUEUE-DIRECTORY name must be absolute.

    The QUEUE-DIRECTORY holds files to be printed.  When
    it is being written, such a file has the .out
    extension.  When it is ready for printing, the
    extension name is changed to .ps.  When it has been
    printed, the extension name is changed to .done.

    The printer_server reads commands from its standard
    input and executes them.  These commands are:

    get FILE
        Return the QUEUE-DIRECTORY/FILE file in the
	standard output.

    done FILE
        Change the extension of QUEUE-DIRECTORY/FILE to
	.done.

    listall
        List all the files in the QUEUE-DIRECTORY, one
	line per file name, in lexical order.

    After producing any required output, each of these
    commands outputs a line containing just:

    	%%-HPCM_DONE-%%

    Any errors are announced first in lines of the form:

        %%-HPCM_ERROR-%% error message

    It is assumed such lines never appear in a post-
    script file or as a file name.
