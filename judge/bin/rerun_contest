rerun_contest [-force|-norun]

    Given a subdirectory named `ORIGINAL_MAIL' in the
    judging directory, this program re-creates the
    `mail' subdirectory and re-runs the autojudge on all
    its submissions.

    To use this program, make a copy of the judging di-
    rectory and its subdirectories (using `cp -r' or
    `tar cf, tar xf') and working in the copy, rename
    the `mail' subdirectory to `ORIGINAL_MAIL' and then
    run this program as many time as you like.  The
    requirement that you produce the `ORIGINAL_MAIL'
    directory by hand is a safety measure intended to
    prevent this program from being run on a live con-
    test.

    This program specifically does the following in
    its judging directory (which is the copy of the
    original):

    (1) Moves any `contest' link or subdirectory to
        `ORIGINAL_CONTEST' provided the latter does
	not exist.  This is a safety measure intended
	to prevent contact with any original contest
	directory.

    (2) Adds stuff to the end of `hpcm_judging.rc', if
        the stuff is not already there, to suppress
	authentication checks and suppress mailing
	replies back to the contestant.

	Note that if you want to update old stuff pre-
	viously placed in this file by rerun_contest,
	you must delete the old stuff by hand and
	rerun this program.

	The stuff added is marked by lines:

	    ##### BEGIN RERUN_CONTEST STUFF #####
	and
	    ##### END RERUN_CONTEST STUFF #####

	You can edit this stuff, or make your own stuff
	from scratch surrounded by the above lines.

    (3) Repairs any broken links in the `solutions' sub-
        directory.  If this fails for some link, this
	program stops unless given the `-force' option.

	To repair a link named P, this program selects
	the first of the following directories that
	exist:
		~/hpcm/problem_library
		$hpcm_directory/problem_library
		
	In the selected directory this program searches
	the following in order:

		demos/P
		public/P
		private/P

	and uses the first of these that is a directory.

    (4) Deletes any existing `mail' subdirectory of the
        judging directory and then remakes an empty
	version.

    (5) Gives a-x permission to the judging directory
        and the new `mail' subdirectory so JAVA will
	work.

    (6) For each submission subdirectory in `ORIGINAL-
        MAIL', makes a subdirectory with the name in
	`mail' and copies the `Received_Mail' file from
	the `ORIGINAL_MAIL' submission subdirectory to
	the `mail' submission subdirectory.  If a sub-
	mission subdirectory has no readable Received_
	Mail file, a note is printed and the subdirec-
	tory is ignored.

    (7) Unless the `-norun' option is given, invokes
        dispatchmail on all the submission subdirector-
	ies of `mail'."
