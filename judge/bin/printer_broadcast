printer_pipe [-P] filename [username]

    file if that is readable, or the printer named in
    the
    
    	contest-directory/printer
    
    file otherwise, or if neither file is readable, use
    the printer named in the PRINTER environment var-
    iable.  The printing to each printer is done just
    like hpcm/contestant/bin/printer_pipe, except the
    \`where' argument is replaced by \`JUDGE', and
    printer names beginning with \`!' are ignored (so
    contestant specified printers are ignored).
    
    The standard input to this program should be a
    file to be piped to the printers.  It is usually a
    postscript file, but can be ASCII with form feeds.

    If the -P option is given, the list of printer
    names is output, and no printing is done."
