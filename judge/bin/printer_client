printer_client PRIVATE-KEY REMOTE-ACCOUNT [PRINTER]

    Get files queued for printing in a remote queue and
    print them on a local printer.  The PRIVATE-KEY is
    a file containing an ssh private key.  The REMOTE-
    ACCOUNT is an ssh login account name and names the
    remote queue.  The PRINTER is the local printer,
    or the local default printer if PRINTER is not
    given.

    The authorized_keys file of the REMOTE-ACCOUNT must
    contain the line

        command=\"printer_server QUEUE-DIRECTORY\" ...

    which invokes the printer_server program that works
    with printer_client to move files to be printed
    from the remote QUEUE-DIRECTORY to the current
    directory and from there to the printer.

    Printer_client reads and executes commands from its
    standard input.  If no input is received within a
    set time (default 30 seconds), printer_client exe-
    cutes the \`get' command which gets and prints any
    unprinted queue files, and then resumes waiting for
    another command (or another timeout).  Files to be
    printed are put in the local (printer_client's)
    current directory with extension .ps, and when the
    file is printed, its extension there is changed to
    .done.

    The common commands are:

        get	Get any unprinted files and print them.
		Files in the queue with extension .ps
		are copied to the current directory
		(of the printer_client program).  Then
		they are printed and their extension
		is changed to .done in both the server
		queue and in the current printer_
		client directory.

	list	List recent files.  Ready (.ps) files
		and recently printed (recent .done)
		files are listed.

	time [SECONDS]
		Reset the time interval between when
		printer_client is ready to read the
		next command and when it executes an
		automatic \`get' command.  The interval
		time is in seconds, with default of 30
		seconds.  The value 0 means infinity.

		If [SECONDS] is not given, the current
		time is printed.

    Other occassionally useful command are the follow-
    ing.  In all these commands, FILE must have exten-
    sion .ps or .done.


	listfiles
	        List all the files in the server queue.
		File names have date and time and are
		in cronological order.  File extensions
		are changed to indicate status:

		    .out    Still being written.
		    .ps	    Ready to print.
		    .done   Printed.

	get FILE
		Copy FILE from server into current
		directory.

	sum FILE
		Check that the server and the local
		directory both have a copy of FILE and
		both copies have the same MD5 sum.
		The extension may be .ps or .done and
		need not match the extension of either
		copy of the file if that extension is
		either .ps or .done.

	print FILE
		Ditto but then print file and if its
		extension is .ps, change its extension
		to .done in current and server
		directories.

	done FILE
		If FILE has the .ps extension, just
		change the extension to .done in the
		current and server directories.

	ready FILE
		If FILE has the .done extension, just
		change the extension to .ps in the
		current and server directories.

	remove FILE
		Remove the file from local directory and
		and server.

	debug [on|off]
		If the debug switch is on, a trace of
		communications between printer_client
		and the remote server is printed.  With
		no option, the switch is toggled.  The
		\`on' and \`off' options set the switch.

		Lines sent to the server are prefaced
		with \`---> ', and lines received from
		the server are prefaced with \`<--- '.
		See \`printer_server -doc' for documen-
		tation describing the traced lines.
