printer_client PRIVATE-KEY REMOTE-ACCOUNT PRINTER

    Get files queued for printing in a remote queue and
    print them on a local printer.  The PRIVATE-KEY is
    a file containing an ssh private key.  The REMOTE-
    ACCOUNT is an ssh login account name and names the
    remote queue.  The PRINTER is the local printer.

    The authorized_keys file of the REMOTE-ACCOUNT must
    contain the line

        command=\"printer_server QUEUE-DIRECTORY\" ...

    which invokes the printer_server program that works
    with printer_client to move files to be printed
    from the remote QUEUE-DIRECTORY to the local /tmp
    files and from there to the printer.

    Printer_client reads and executes commands from its
    standard input.  If no input is received within a
    set time (default 30 seconds), printer_client exe-
    cutes the \`get' command which gets and prints any
    unprinted queue files, and then resumes waiting for
    another command (or another timeout).

    The commands are:

        get	Get any unprinted files and print them.

	list	List recent status: files recently
	        printed, etc.

	listall	List everything known by the server,
	        including metadata for all files ever
		put in the remote queue.

	time SECONDS
		Reset the time interval between when
		printer_client is ready to read the
		next command and when it executes an
		automatic \`get' command.  The interval
		time is in seconds, with default of 30
		seconds.  The value 0 means infinity.

	debug [on|off|doc]
		If the debug switch is on, a trace of
		communications between printer_client
		and the remote server is printed.  With
		no option, the switch is toggled.  The
		\`on' and \`off' options set the switch.
		The \`doc' option prints documentation
		describing the trace lines.
