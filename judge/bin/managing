Division of Responsibility
-------- -- --------------

This document describes what a contest/facility manager
needs to know in a situation in which a judging account
is shared between a contest/facility manager, who
maintains a particular contest or practice facility, and
a software manager, who makes new contests/facilites,
manages the HPCM program code, and provides other
services, such as backup.

The contest/facility manager of a contest or practice
facility named nnnn has responsibility for the existence
and contents of all directories and files with names of
the forms:

	~/*_nnnn_*
	~/*_nnnn

Included are the contest judging directory with a name
of the form

	~/judging_nnnn_*

and the contest directory named

	~/contest_nnnn

However, the software manager, and not the contest/
facility manager, will make initial versions of these
last two directories, and then the contest/facility
manager will assume responsibility for them.  Thus the
contest/facility manager does not need to make contests
or facilities, but only maintain them.

The software manager has responsibility for the exis-
tence and contents of all other files, with a few
exceptions documented in `Account Control Files' below,
and.  In particular, the software manager is responsible
for the program files in ~/hpcm.

Account Control Files
------- ------- -----

The software manager is responsible for ~/.bashrc, but
upon request will add to its end code to read files
with names of the form

	~/.bashrc_nnnn

where nnnn is the name of a contest/facility.  See the
end of the ~/.bashrc file to see if this is already
enabled.

Any manager may add, modify, or delete their own line(s)
to

	~/.ssh/authorized_keys
	~/.ssh/known_hosts

(the latter is modified semi-automatically).  Notify the
software manager when changes are made to

	~/.ssh/authorized_keys

so a backup may be kept (typically this is kept in
~/.ssh/RCS/authorized_keys,v).

Contest/Facility Parameters
---------------- ----------

The parameters for a contest/facility named nnnn are in
the file:

    ~/judging_nnnn_*/hpcm_judging.rc

The first parts of this file contain parameters that
must be particularized for the contest/facility, and
these parts must be read and edited by the contest/
facility manager.

After changing parameters, `make' should be run by
executing:

    cd ~/judging_nnnn_*
    make

so that the new parameter settings will take effect.

There are some more detailed notes on some of the para-
meters that need to be set in the following sections.

Making the Contest/Facility Description
------ --- ---------------- -----------

The contest description is made in the file

    ~/judging_nnnn_*/help/this_contest

and automatically copied from there (by `make' and
`makecontest') to the file

    ~/contest_nnnn/help/this_contest

and to the web pages file

    ~/judging_nnnn_*/web/this_contest

Contestants/Students can access this file from local
accounts by executing `help', and if there is a web
page, this file is the `description' part of the web
page.

Normally you can just compute this file using `make' by
setting the hpcm_judging.rc parameters:

	this_contest_prefix
	this_contest_postfix

These parameters can be edited, and `make' can be
executed to recompute the file.  However, you can also
edit the file

    ~/judging_nnnn_*/help/this_contest

directly.  Once you have edited this file directly,
further runs of `make' will not change the file, but
will copy the most recent edited version to

    ~/contest_nnnn/help/this_contest
and ~/judging_nnnn_*/web/this_contest

So in the future you will have to maintain the file
strictly by editing it.


Making the Contest/Facility Web Page
------ --- ---------------- --- ----

The web page is made in the directory

    ~/judging_nnnn_*/web

and a .tar file of this director is made in

    ~/judging_nnnn_*/web.tar

This latter may be copied to another computer, unpacked,
and installed as a web page.  Its principal file is

    ~/judging_nnnn_*/web/index.html

which is automatically created from parameters with
names of the form web_* in the file

    ~/judging_nnnn_*/hpcm_judging.rc

For example, if the web_manager parameter is defined
as an email address, this is displayed appropriately
at the bottom of the .../web/index.html file.

The beginning of that file is the contents of the
web_prefix parameter and the end of that file, before
the manager annotation, is the contents of the web_
posfix parameter, so the contents of .../web/index.htmn
is generally under the control of the parameters.  The
middle of the file references a copy of the

    ~/judging_nnnn_*/help/this_contest

file too describe contest/facility details, and
references copies of the problem descriptions included
in the web page.  Also, if the web_help_URL parameter
is not \"\", it is used as a reference to a help files
web page.

If the web_solutions_password parameter is \"ppp\" and
not \"\", then the directory

    ~/judging_nnnn_*/web/private/ppp/

is created containing problem solutions and with an
automatically created

    ~/judging_nnnn_*/web/private/ppp/index.html

that has the contents of the web_solutions_prefix para-
meter at its beginning.  The solutions directory is
protected so that `ppp' must be known in order to read
the page.

Also, if the web_scoreboard_URL parameter is not \"\",
it is used as a reference to a scoreboard posted on the
web.  Such a scoreboard is not strictly necessary if
students using the contest/facility are given accounts,
since they can then access the scoreboard by using the
`scoreboard' command when they are logged in.  But if a
scoreboard is to be posted on the web, you should set
the scoreboard_commands parameter in hpcm_judging.rc
to send the scoreboard to the web site location whenever
the scoreboard changes.  For example, if you use

set scoreboard_commands {
    { sendscoreboard email
      \"setscoreboard<myaccount@mycomputer.edu>\"
      setscoreboard
      \"head -c 10000 >./public_html/scoreboardpage;\
       chmod 644 ./public_html/scoreboardpage\" } }

the scoreboard, when changed, will be piped into the
command

    ~/judging_nnnn_*/secure/sendscoreboard

which in turn sends the scoreboard as the body of an
email message to

    setscoreboard<myaccount@mycomputer.edu>

The file

    ~/judging_nnnn_*/secure/sendscoreboard_procmailrc

is also created which can be appended to the .procmailrc
file of the myaccount@mycomputer.edu account to receive
the scoreboard copies automatically and pipe them in a
protected way to the file ~/public_html/scoreboardpage
in that account.  You can use a different file name, of
course.

Instead of using email, ssh, or some completely differ-
ent mechanism can be use to send scoreboards.  See the
scoreboard_commands documentation in

    ~/judging_nnnn_*/hpcm_judging.rc
and
    ~/hpcm/judge/lib/hpcm_judging.rc

for details.
