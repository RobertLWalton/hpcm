Division of Responsibility
-------- -- --------------

This document describes what a contest/facility manager
needs to know in a situation in which a judging account
is shared between a contest/facility manager, who
maintains a particular contest or practice facility, and
a software manager, who makes new contests/facilites,
manages the HPCM program code, and provides other
services, such as backup.

The contest/facility manager of a contest or practice
facility named nnnn has responsibility for the existence
and contents of all directories with names of the forms

	~/*_nnnn_*
	~/*_nnnn

Included are the contest judging directory with a name
of the form

	~/judging_nnnn_*

and the contest directory named

	~/contest_nnnn

However, the software manager, and not the contest/
facility manager, will make initial versions of these
last two directories, and then the contest/facility
manager will assume responsibility for them.  So the
contest/facility manager does not need to make contests
or facilities, but only maintain them.

The software manager has responsibility for the exis-
tence and contents of all other files, with a few
exceptions documented in `Account Control Files' below,
and.  In particular, the software manager is responsible
for the program files in ~/hpcm.

Account Control Files
------- ------- -----

The software manager is responsible for ~/.bashrc, but
upon request will add to its end code to read files
with names of the form

	~/.bashrc_nnnn

where nnnn is the name of a contest/facility.  See the
end of the ~/.bashrc file to see if this is already
enabled.

Any manager may add, modify, or delete their own line(s)
to

	~/.ssh/authorized_keys
	~/.ssh/known_hosts

(the latter is modified semi-automatically).  Notify the
software manager when changes are made to

	~/.ssh/authorized_keys

so a backup may be kept (typically this is kept in
~/.ssh/RCS).
