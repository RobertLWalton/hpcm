    Print the files named (or the standard input if
    the filenames are missing) in a format well suited
    to files with lines of 56 columns.   This format
    puts 2 file pages per paper page, and permits at
    least 40 lines on a file page.

    The printer used is the value of the PRINTER
    environment variable.  If the -o option is given,
    the output is written to the standard output and
