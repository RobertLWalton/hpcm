    This program examines subdirectories of the mail
    directory that have names of the form:

    	date-<<submitter>>-submission

    It outputs information that tells what files
    exist in these subdirectories and when the files
    were last modified.

    Specifically, for each directory a line is output
    with the form

	sub date {submitter}

    where `sub' denotes `subdirectory' of the mail dir-
    ectory and the date and submitter of this line are
    copied from the subdirectory name.  After this line
    the following lines are output indicating which
    files exist in the subdirectory and what the modifi-
    cation times (mtimes) of these files are:

    	rec  time {subject}	Mtime of and `Subject'
				field of Received_Mail.

    	ext  time {filename}	Mtime of and name of
				last file extracted from
				Received_Mail by
				extractmail.

	bin  time1 time2	Mtimes of the binary
				and .cerr files, respec-
				tively.

	out  time1 time2	Mtimes of the .out and
				.err files, respective-
				ly.

	sco   time1 time2 {autoscore} {manualscore}
				Mtimes and contents of
				Auto_Score and
				Manual_Score,
				respectively.

	rep   time1 time2	Mtimes of Reply_Mail
				and No_Reply,
				respectively.

	his   time		Mtime of
				Reply_Mail_History.

	got   time		Mtime of Gotten.

	pid   time1 time2	Mtime of Dispatch_PID,
				and time mtime was
				read, respectively.

	err   time {filename}	Mtime and name of file
				with name matching:
				    *-unchecked-error

	chk   time {filename}	Mtime and name of file
				with name matching:
				    *-checked-error

    If any file is missing, its time is `{}', and any
    contents are also `{}', e.g., for a missing score
    file.  If all files whose times are in one of the
    above lines are missing, the line is not output.

    All the non-missing times are integer numbers of
    seconds relative to the date in the `sub' line that
    begins the set of lines for a subdirectory.

    If arguments are given, these are taken as the names
    of the directories to look at.  These must be valid
    relative to the current directory, and can include
    names whose last component is not of the form

    	date-<<submitter>>-submission

    in which case instead of a `sub' line there will be
    a line of the form

	dir date {directory-name}

    where the date is taken as the mtime of the direc-
    tory.  Typically the directory is a log directory.

    This program logs errors in the log directory."
