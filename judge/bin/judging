Making Judging Accounts
------ ------- --------

A judging account is a normal user account with the
following special considerations.

If the judging account has its own group, the umask
should be set by

	umask 27

which disables access except by the judging account and
its group, and disables write access by the judging
group.  This permits auxilary judging accounts (see
below).

If the judging account has a shared group, the umask
should be set by

	umask 77

Autologout should be disabled if csh or tcsh is being
used by

	unset autologout

It is a good idea to capture ALL email arriving at the
judging account, just in case there are questions of
lost mail.  This can be done by putting

    :0 c:
    hpcm_mbox

at the beginning of the ~/.procmailrc file, on UNIX
systems that use procmail.  On UNIX systems that use
forwarding, the ~/.forward file can be set to

    \JJJ, /home/JJJ/hpcm_mbox

to store all mail in ~/hpcm_mbox, where JJJ is the
judging account name and /home/JJJ is the home directory
of that account.

link .hpcm_contest for sq and ??
If the judge may want to use facilities that are
normally used by contestants or by auxilary judges,
then it will be necessary to symbolically link
~/.hpcm_contest to the contest directory.  E.g., use

    ln -s ~/contest... ~/.hpcm_contest


Hpcm must be installed in the judging directory: see
the separate document `Installing HPCM'.  This typically
installs HPCM in the ~/hpcm directory and puts the
~/hpcm/judge/bin directory in the PATH of the judging
account.

Making a Contest
------ - -------

One judging account can have many different contests.

To make a new contest, select the contest type TTT you
want, and follow the instructions in

    hpcm/examples/TTT_contest/Makefile


Judging a Formal Contest
------- - ------ -------

You should review Formal Contest Emergencies before
judging a formal contest.

After setting up the contest, one should do the
following:

1.  Run `startcontest' when the contest starts to make
    the problems gettable by the contestants using
    `hpcm_get'.

2.  Check submissions and queries by running the
    `tracker' program.  This program finds submissions
    (including queries) that you have not yet responded
    to.  One can also use the `lookat' program to check
    up on things you have already responded to.


Auxilary Judging
-------- -------

Must set `source ~/...' in hpcm_judging.rc to `source /home/...'.
