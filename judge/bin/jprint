    Print the files named (or the standard input if the
    filenames are missing) to all contest printers in a
    format well suited to files with lines of 80 col-
    umns.   This format puts 1 file page per paper page,
    and permits at least 60 lines on a file page.

    The \`printer_broadcast' program is used to locate
    printers and update printer_jobs."
