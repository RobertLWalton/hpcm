scorefinder

    This program examines subdirectories of the mail
    directory that have names of the form:

    	date-<<submitter>>-submission

    It selects subdirectories that have one or both of
    the score files:

    	$auto_score_file
    	$manual_score_file

    For each such, this program outputs one line of the
    form:

    	date submitter problem score

    In this line, the date is taken literally from the
    subdirectory name.  The submitter is taken from the
    directory name but has any `@' and characters
    following the `@' stripped off.  The program is the
    submitted file name with its extension removed; this
    is found by reading the subject field of any
    $received_file file in the subdirectory, and using
    the problem name `UNKNOWN' if this cannot be done
    or the subject field has the wrong format.  The
    score is one of:

      mc  $manual_score_file	== `Completely Correct'
      mi  $manual_score_file	!= `Completely Correct'
      ac  $auto_score_file	== `Completely Correct'
      ai  $auto_score_file	!= `Completely Correct'

    where the $auto_score_file file is ignored if the
    $manual_score_file file exits.

    This program logs errors in the log directory."
