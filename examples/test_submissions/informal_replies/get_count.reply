---<>--<>---<>--<>---<>----- demos/count/Makefile:
# Makefile for the `count' Demonstration Problem
#
# File:		Makefile
# Date:		Tue Oct  4 21:27:36 EDT 2005
#
# Exactly ONE of the four files count.c (C), count.cc
# (C++), count.java (Java), or count.lsp (Commonlisp)
# should exist.
#
# UNIX commands supported by this Makefile:
#
#	make		Same as `make count.out'.
#
#	make count	Makes the binary program file
#			`count' by running gcc on
#			count.c, or g++ on count.cc,
#			or javac on count.java,
#			or hpcm_clisp on count.lsp,
#			depending upon which of count.c,
#			count.cc, count.java, or
#			count.lsp exist.  Also makes a
#			shell script named `count' for
#			count.java and count.lsp files.
#			Does nothing if `count' is more
#			up to date than count.c,
#			count.cc, count.java, or
#			count.lsp.
#
#	make count.out	Makes `count' as above and
#			then runs it with standard
#			input coming from the file
#			count.in.  Puts the standard
#			output in the file count.out,
#			and then copies that to the
#			screen.  Does nothing, however,
#			if count.out is more recent
#			than both count.in and count.
#			
#	make submit	Makes `count.out' just to be
#			sure that nothing crashes, and
#			then e-mails count.c, count.cc,
#			count.java, or count.lsp to the
#			judges.
#
#	make in-submit	Ditto, but requests that if
#			the score is `Incorrect Output'
#			or `Formatting Error', the
#			judge's input for the failed
#			test case will be returned in
#			e-mail to the contestant.
#
#	make inout-submit
#			Ditto but requests both the
#			judge's input and the judge's
#			output for the test case.
#
#	make solution-submit
#			Like `make submit' but requests
#			that if the score is `Completely
#			Correct' the judge's solution
#			will be returned in e-mail to
#			the contestant.
#	
#	make clean	Removes `count', count.out, and
#			other intermediate files that
#			might exist, such as `core',
#			`count.class', or count.fas.

Count Demo README	    Fri Oct  7 08:17:56 EDT 2005

The files in this demo directory are:

    public/count/Makefile	Commented Makefile.
    public/count/README		Usage Info.
    public/count/count.in	Judges input.
    public/count/count.test	Judges output.
    public/count/count.txt	Problem description.
    public/count/count1.c	Solution in C.
    public/count/count1.cc	Solution in C++.
    public/count/count1.java    Solution in JAVA.
    public/count/count1.lsp	Solution in COMMONLISP.

There may be other files used exclusively by the judge,
such as .rc, .jin, and .jtest files.

The Makefile is commented, as opposed to most problem
Makefiles.  For a non-demo problem you are only given
the .txt file and the Makefile.

To run the demo (under UNIX), first

    cp count1.yy count.yy

for exactly ONE of yy = c, cc, java, or lsp.  Then

	make

To check that the output is correct

	diff count.out count.test

Then to submit the demo

	make submit

If you want to edit the solution you chose, you may
first need to

	chmod u+w count.yy

(for the right yy), to make the file writable.

You should try introducing an error in the file and
resubmitting to see the response.  If you are in a
contest that permits `in-submit' and `inout-submit',
try

	make in-submit

and then

	make inout-submit

with a source file that has an error which makes it
produce incorrect output.

Read the Makefile for more information.

If you have a non-UNIX system, you can submit the file
count1.yy directly by sending email to the judge with
subject `submit count.yy' (note there is no `1' here)
and body equal to the file count1.yy (here there is a
`1').  You may run count1.yy using your own system with
count.in as the standard input in order to generate
count.out.

Although in this directory the problem description is
in a .txt file, in other problem directories the problem
description may be in a .html, .htm, or .ps (postscript)
file.

Paragraph Character/Word/Line Counting.

The Itsy Bitsy Counting Company has a job counting the
number of characters, words, and lines in a paragraph.

A paragraph is a sequence of 1 or more non-blank lines.

All the characters of a line count EXCEPT the trailing
new line.

A word is a sequence of non-space (non ' ') characters
on a line, and is separated from other words on the
same line by sequences of space ( ' ' ) characters.

The only whitespace characters in the input are space
and newline ( ' ' and '\n' ).  No line has more than
100 characters in it, not counting the new line at
the end.

Paragraphs are separated by one or more blank lines.
A blank line may have whitespace characters, but
nothing else.

The paragraphs in the input are numbered 1, 2, ... .
The program reads its standard input, and for each
paragraph in that input, prints the paragraph
number and the counts, in exactly the following format:

Paragraph #: # lines, # words, # characters.

where each # denotes 1 or more decimal digits.

Example Input:
