1. See help/scoreboard for a discussion of how to
   interpret the scoreboard.

2. In this contest, the start time of a problem is the
   time that the problem is gotten by a contestant using
   hpcm_get.

3. The problem `count' is not really part of the
   contest.  Its a demo.  It will disappear from the
   scoreboard when the contest gets going.
