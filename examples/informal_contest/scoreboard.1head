1. See help/scoreboard for a discussion of how to interpret
   the scoreboard.

2. In this contest, the start time of a team is the time
   that the team gets its first problem using hpcm_get.

3. The problem `count' is not really part of the contest.  Its a
   demo.  It will disappear from the scoreboard when the contest
   gets going.
