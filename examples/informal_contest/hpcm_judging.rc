# directory of the current (judge's) account.
#

# Browser to use for javahelp.
#
set browser lynx

# Location of JAVA API index for browser to use to

# TCL list of addresses to email scoreboard to.  If this
# list contains zzz<YYY>, then every time the scoreboard
# is updated it will be emailed to `zzz<YYY>', so in the
# account YYY .procmailrc file you should put something
# like the following to copy the scoreboard into the

#	:0 b:
#	* ^To:.*zzz

#
#	INDEX-FILE-NAME,
#	    SUBDIRECTORY/=problems/,

#
# where the problems are in the SUBDIRECTORY of the
# directory holding the index file.  See below for
# examples.

# problems are in subdirectories of ~/ppp.  Because the
# problems are subdirectories of ~/ppp which contains
# the index file, `SUBDIRECTORY/' is the omitted.
# $env(HOME) is the home directory of the current
# (judge's) account.  `ALL' means include all problems
# listed in the index.

# See hpcm/judge/lib/hpcm_judging.rc `makecontest_
# arguments' for more details, and `makecontest -doc'
# for complete details.

# Set the following if you want to use `makeweb' to
# make a web page.  Leave as "" parameters you do not
# want to use (e.g., if web_solutions_password is "" no
# solutions web page will be made).
#
# The web_manager_address will be listed as a contact
# on the web page.  The web_solutions_password PPP will
# be used to name a subdirectory `private/PPP' of the
# web page directory that will hold the solutions.  No
# link will be made to this directory, and the `private'
# subdirectory will be unreadable to the world, so PPP
# will act as a password.  The web_help_URL is the URL
# of the help page (see hpcm/contestant/help Makefile)
# relative to the contest web page.  The web_scoreboard_
# URL is the URL of the scoreboard relative to the web
# page; usually this is posted by using scoreboard_
# addresses (see above).

# with a given number of blank lines above that.  If you
# have a taller display, increase window_height.
#

# tioning because some of the information they display
# is being scrolled off the top of the screen.
#
set window_blank_height 16

# Set to contest directory, in case the $judging_
# directory/contest link needs to be made.  If needed

# `judging' replaced by `contest' and trailing password
# removed will be used.
#
# set contest_directory $env(HOME)/contest_TBD

# Set to the prototype account (as per SETUP_PROTOTYPE).
# If not set, the unique account with name of the form
# *[-_]proto and readable files home/setup.tar, home/
# empty.ls, and home/setup.ls is used, if there is such
# a unique account.
#
# set hpcm_prototype_account TBD

# Set to "no" if you do not want makecontest to run
# `makescoreboard start'.
#

# testant determine his/her own printer by placing the

The command `help' will display this file.  The impor-
tant help and demonstration problem files are available
via the contest web page, or you have been given a
printout of these files.

This is an `informal' contest.  The command

	help informal_contest

displays more details about informal contests.

To display a list of the help files available use the
command `help index'.  Note that if something in the
index has the name `help/topic' you use the command
`help topic' to view it.

You have been given a password and an account name.  If
you have an xterminal, the xcsh command will make more
windows: see `help xterminals'.

You can print on the printer of your choice, or get
printouts emailed to you, by making a ~/PRINTER file.
See `help print' for details.

The command `hpcm_get' will get a demonstration problem
into your directory ~/demos/count (~ denotes your home
directory).  Read ~/demos/count/README and ~/demos/
count/Makefile and practice submitting the demonstration
problem.

To find out what problems are available use the command
`help problems'.  The command `hpcm_get problems/foo'
will get the problem named `foo' into your directory
`~/problems/foo' where you can work on it.
[include_if { $scoring_type == "problem" } "
In order to get good scores on problems, you must AVOID
hpcm_get'ting a problem UNTIL you are READY to swiftly
solve it, as the time between when you hpcm_get the pro-
blem and when you first submit a correct solution for
the problem is the problem time on the scoreboard.
"][include_if { $scoring_type == "team" } "
In order to get good scores on problems, you must AVOID
hpcm_get'ting ANY non-demonstration problem UNTIL you
are READY to swiftly solve ALL problems, as the time you
hpcm_get your first problem is the start time of the
contest for you.  For each problem, the difference be-
tween this contest start time and the time when you
first submit a correct solution for the problem is the
problem time on the scoreboard.
"]
The command `scoreboard' will display the scoreboard.
See `help scoreboard'.  See `help solving' for details
on how to solve a problem.
[include_if { [regexp paper $description_type] } "
You have been given problem descriptions on paper."][
 include_if { [regexp web $description_type] } "
Problem descriptions are available on the web."][
 include_if { [regexp get $description_type] } "
Problem descriptions are available in files in the prob-
lem directory gotten by hpcm_get.  These files have one
of the extensions .txt, .html, .htm, .ps, .pdf, etc.
The print commands only print plain text files, but you
can email other files to your home computer where they
can be displayed."]

To send a question to the contest manager DO NOT try
to e-mail the manager directly.  Instead edit the ques-
tion into a file qqq and use the command:

	hpcm_sendmail < qqq
[include-if { [llength $response_list] == 0 } "
You CANNOT use the alternative submit commands that
make `in-submit', `inout-submit', or\
	`solution-submit'.][
[include-if { [llength $response-list] > 0 } "
You can use commands that `make' any of the following:

    submit $response_list

but ONLY these submit commands.
