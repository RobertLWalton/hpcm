1. See help/scoreboard for a discussion of how to
   interpret the scoreboard.

2. In this contest, the start time of the contest is the
   time that written problem descriptions are passed out
   to the contestants.  After this time, hpcm_get will
   get the problems and `help problems' will display an
   index of the problems.

3. The problem `count' is not really part of the
   contest.  Its a demo.  It will disappear from the
   scoreboard when the contest gets going.
