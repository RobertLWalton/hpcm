The documents are also included in the tar.
<P>
All public HPCM files, including all files in the above
tar, are public domain except for the signature files
above.  These signature files are copyrighted with
verbatim copying permitted to everyone.
<P>
A separate tar of public HPCM solution files exists,
but this and all solution files should never be made
public on the web.  HPCM autojudges can be configured to
email judge's solutions back to submitters of correct
submissions, allowing these submitters to compare their
correct solutions with the judge's solution.  Judge's
of contests need solutions to check for possible errors
in test data.  Judge's of prospective contests can
contact <code>CONTACT</code> to obtain the solution tar.
<P>
The CVS repository is PRIVATE and not available to the
public.
