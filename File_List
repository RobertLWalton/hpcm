# The useful lines of this file consist of a keyword
# followed by one or more tabs followed by a file name.
# The keywords and order of lines in this file mainly
# control the ease of printing of the files.  The
# key words are:
#
#   user	Files for the contestant.
#
#   remote	Files for the remote user: i.e., the
#		user who does not get an account but
#		does everything by email.
#
#   pascal	Files just for pascal users.
#
#   problem	Problem descriptions for contestants.
#		But BEWARE: many of these should be
#		held in confidence for use in informal
#		contests.
#
#   library	Files for the librarian.  The librarian
#		will also want the `problem' files.
#
#   system	Files for the system maintainer.
#
#   test	Files for the system tester.
#
# Some files are listed more than once with different
# keywords.  All keywords begin with a letter.  So to
# get a list of all files select for keywords beginning
# with a letter (as opposed to `#') and sort the output
# removing duplicates. 
#
# The filenames are relative to this, the root HPCM
# directory.
