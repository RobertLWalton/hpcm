<CENTER><H2>Different Kinds of Contests</H2></CENTER>

    <UL>

    <LI> <A HREF="contest/formal_contest">
 	 help/formal_contest</A>:
	About formal contests, in which you have to
	participate at a designated time.   You are
	given problems only on paper, at the start of
	the contest.  Judging is usually manual, though
	an autojudge may be used to give quick
	preliminary estimates of submission scores.

    <LI> <A HREF="contest/informal_contest">
	 help/informal_contest</A>:
	About informal contests, in which you may
	participate on your own time schedule.  There is
	an operation to get a problem, and the problem
	time is between when you get the problem and
	when you submit its solution; or when your team
	gets its FIRST problem, and when each problem's
	solution is submitted.  Judging is done by an
	autojudge.

    <LI> <A HREF="contest/untimed_contest">
	 help/untimed_contest</A>:
	About untimed contests, in which you have as
	much time as you like to do a problem, without
	the time affecting your score.  The contest
	is usually scored according to how you make
	submissions of incorrect solutions.  You may
	submit so as to get back the judge's input for
	the first test case that fails, or to get back
	the judge's input and judge's output for that
	test case.  The more such feedback you ask for,
	the greater is the penalty for an incorrect
	submission.  Judging is done by an autojudge.
