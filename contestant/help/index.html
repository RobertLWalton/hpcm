    <LI> <A HREF="contest/formal_contest">
 	 help/formal_contest</A>:
	About formal contests, in which you have to
	participate at a designated time, and time is a factor
	in scoring the contest.  You are
	given problems only on paper, at the start of
	the contest.

    <LI> <A HREF="contest/informal_contest">
	 help/informal_contest</A>:
	About informal contests, in which you may
	participate on your own time schedule, but in which
	time is a factor in scoring the contest.  There is
	an operation to get either get all the problems,
	or to get problems individually, and the time between
	between when you get a problem and when you submit
	its solution is used in scoring.  Problem statements
	may be delivered electronically
	when you get a problem.  Scoring is done by
	an autojudge.

    <LI> <A HREF="contest/untimed_contest">
	 help/untimed_contest</A>:
	About untimed contests, in which you have as
	much time as you like to do a problem, without
	the time affecting your score.  Problem statements
	are put on the web, and scoring is done by an
	autojudge.
