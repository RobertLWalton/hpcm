<CENTER><H2>Different Kinds of Contests</H2></CENTER>

    <ul>
    <li> <a href="email/email_contest">
	 help/email_contest</a>:
	About email contests, in which you provide our
	OWN account and email solutions to an autojudge.
	There is an operation (hpcm_get) to get a
	problem, and the problem time is between when
	you get the problem and when you submit its
	solution.  See <a href=#email>below</a> for more
	details.

    <li> <a href="informal/informal_contest">
	 help/informal_contest</a>:
	About informal contests, in which an account is
	given to you but you may participate in the
	contest on your own time schedule.  There is an
	operation (hpcm_get) to get a problem, and the
	problem time is between when you get the problem
	and when you submit its solution; or when your
	team gets its FIRST problem, and when each
	problem's solution is submitted.  Judging is
	usually done by an autojudge.
	See <a href=#terminals>below</a> for more
	information about terminal setup.

    <li> <a href="formal/formal_contest">
 	 help/formal_contest</a>:
	About formal contests, in which an account is
	given to you and you have to participate at a
	designated time.   You are given problems
	only on paper, at the start of the contest.
	Judging is usually manual, though an autojudge
	may be used to give quick preliminary estimates
	of submission scores.
	See <a href=#terminals>below</a> for more
	information about terminal setup.
