This file is for those who are using an account provided
by the contest managers, and who are logging into that
account using ssh with X-windows.  Note that to do this
from UNIX you may need to use the -X option to ssh, as
in
	ssh -X someaccount@somecomputer


Creating Windows with Xcsh
--------------------------

To create a new window you may use the command:

    xcsh    Start a new X terminal window running your
    	    current shell (this used to be csh but is
	    now probably bash).

            The new window tends to form directly over
	    the top of the leftmost existing window, so
	    one of these windows has to be moved.

Xcsh takes options that change the font and location of
the window formed.  To try a font of a different size,
use the command

    xcsh    PP

where PP is the point size (e.g., 12, 16, 18, 24) de-
sired.

To get more complete documentation of xcsh type the
command `xcsh -doc'.


Destroying a Window
---------- - ------

To destroy a window just type the command `exit', or if
that does not work, `logout'.

BUT BE CAREFUL not to destroy your original (root)
window as doing that may destroy all other windows.
