This file is for those who are using Linux or a MAC and

Connecting From Linux or a MAC
---------- ---- ----- -- - ---

Open a terminal window and use:

	ssh -X someaccount@somecomputer

This will given you a terminal emulator connected to
your account, plus X-windows support.



Creating New Windows with X-Windows and Xsh
-------- --- ------- ---- --------- --- ---

Here we assume you are using a terminal emulator with
X-windows support.  Then to create a new window you may
use the command:

    xsh     Start a new X terminal window running your
    	    current shell.

            The new window tends to form directly over
	    the top of the leftmost existing window, so
	    one of these windows has to be moved.

If gnome-terminal is available, xsh uses it.  Otherwise
is uses xterm.  It can be forced to use xterm by giving
it the `-xterm' option, as in `xsh -xterm'.

If gnome-terminal is used a message will appear telling
you how to select a font.  Also `control +' will
increase the window size, `control -' will decrease it,
`control N' will create a new window, `control T' will
create a new `tab' in the current window.  When the
window size changes, the font size changes correspond-
ingly.

If xterm is used, an additional argument may be given
to xsh which is the font point size.  So

	xsh -xterm 25

will use xterm with 25 point font.  A message will
appear asking you to select a font.

To get more complete documentation of xsh type the
command `xsh -doc'.


Destroying a Window
---------- - ------

To destroy a window just type the command `exit'.

BUT BE CAREFUL NOT TO DESTROY your original (root)
window as doing that may destroy all other windows and
force you to log in again.
