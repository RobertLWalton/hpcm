Interpreting the Scoreboard
------------ --- ----------

The scoreboard lists for each team (contestant account)
a score for each problem and a total score.  Teams with
more problems correct rank higher in the scoring, and
the `total score', which is just a total time score, is
only used to rank teams with the same number of problems
correct.  The team with the smallest total score ranks
highest among all teams with the same number of correct
problems.

Teams are sorted in rank order in the scoreboard, with
highest ranking teams first.

For each team and problem a problem score is given.  The
problem score `......' means the team has not submitted
the problem.  `..../N' for some decimal number N means
the team has submitted the problem N times but all these
submissions are incorrect.

`M:SSsN' for decimal numbers M, SS, and N mean the prob-
lem score is M minutes and SS seconds, and there were N
submissions including N-1 incorrect submissions before
the first correct submission.  The `s' means the time
SS is in seconds.

`H:MMmN' instead means the time is H hours and MM min-
utes, rounded down to the nearest minute.  `D:HHhN'
instead means the time is D days and HH hours, rounded
down to the nearest hour.  `DdN' means the time is D
days, rounded down to the nearest day.  The choice of
time unit, s, m, h, or d, is made to give the problem
time to the greatest accuracy within 6 display charac-
ters, including the unit character.  However the actual
problem time used for computing the total score below
is always in seconds.

The total score it the sum of the correct problem
scores, in seconds.  For some contests a penalty is
added for each incorrect submission of a problem before
the correct submission of that problem.  Typical penal-
ties, if they are being used, are 10 to 20 minutes.
There is no penalty for incorrect submission of a
problem never submitted correctly.

If you see a `*' preceding any problem score or any
total score, this means that one or more submissions
used to compute the score have been scored incorrect by
the autojudge, but are still awaiting review by the
human judge.
