Ranking Submitters
------- ----------

The scoreboard gives for each submitter (contest
account) and for each problem information about the
submissions made by the submitter for the problem.
For each submitter the scoreboard also gives the total
number of problems correctly solved by the submitter,
and typically also gives a total score that distinguish-
es submitters who have the same number of solved pro-
blems.

A submitter may be a team or an individual, depending
on the type of contest.  Here we use the term `sub-
mitter' to mean either `team' or `individual'.

Some contests are completely unscored.  For these the
submitters are listed in alphabetical order, and for
each problem and submitter an indication is given of
whether the submitter has solved the problem, and if
so, the date the problem was solved.

On the other hand, if the contest is being scored, sub-
mitters with more correct solutions appear earlier in
the scoreboard, and each problem solution is given a
score indicated on the scoreboard.

When a contest is being scored, there needs to be some
way of ranking submitters who have the same number of
problems solved.  There are two different methods of
ranking.  The classical way, used in all limited
duration contests, is to measure the time required to
solved each problem.  The other way that we provide,
usable in untimed contests, is to use the number and
kind of incorrect submissions made for each solved pro-
blem.  In either case, each solution is assigned a num-
erical score, these scores are added to produce a score
for each submitter, and problems a submitter never
solves do not count in any way toward scoring or ranking
submitters.

Below we discuss in separate sections timed, untimed,
and unscored contests, so you may read just the appro-
priate section.  However the following is common to
all kinds of contest.

A scoreboard has an entry for each submitter and each
problem.

If there are no submissions for a problem by a submit-
ter, `......' appears in the scoreboard for the submit-
ter and problem.  This also appears if there are no
correct submissions and incorrect submissions are NOT
being reported.  But if incorrect submissions are being
reported and there are some, then `..../N' appears,
where N is the number of incorrect submissions by the
submitter for the problem.

For each submitter in a scored contest the number of
solutions N and total score TTT of submitter are report-
ed in the format `N/TTT'.  For timed contests higher
TTT is worse, but for untimed contests higher TTT is
better.

In some contests, problems are scored first by an auto-
judge, and then if they are not completely correct, the
score is reviewed by a human judge.  If you see a `*'
prefixed or suffixed to any item of scoreboard informa-
tion, this means that one or more submissions used to
compute the item have been scored incorrect by the auto-
judge, but are still awaiting review by the human judge.

Timed Contests
----- --------

When a contest is of limited duration and problems are
being timed to produce a score, each problem is assigned
a start time, which is the time the submitter first sees
the problem description.  For formal contests this time
is the time the contest starts, and the submitters are
handed problem descriptions on paper when the contest
starts.  A solution score is just the difference between
the time the solution was submitted and the start time
of the problem.  The submitter's score is the sum of all
the solution scores for the solutions submitted by the
submitter.

Most importantly note that lower time scores are better,
higher time scores are worse.  Also note that if you
think of problems as being solved consecutively in a
formal contest where all problems have the same start
time, and a submitter solves, say, three problems, the
first in time T1, the second in time T2, and the third
in time T3, then the submitters score is 3*T1 + 2*T2 +
T3, so it pays to solve the easiest problems first.

Solution times are computed in seconds.  Some contests
apply a penalty of typically 20 minutes (1200 seconds)
for each incorrect submission of a problem made before
the first correct submission of the problem.

Solution times may be represented on the scoreboard as
`M:SSsN', with decimal numbers M, SS, and N, meaning
that the solution time is M minutes and SS seconds, and
there were N submissions, including N-1 incorrect sub-
missions, before the first correct submission.  The `s'
means the time SS is in seconds.  N may be omitted if
incorrect submissions are not being reported on the
scoreboard.

`H:MMmN' instead means the time is H hours and MM min-
utes, rounded down to the nearest minute.  `D:HHhN'
instead means the time is D days and HH hours, rounded
down to the nearest hour.  `DdN' means the time is D
days, rounded down to the nearest day.  The choice of
time unit, s, m, h, or d, is made to give the elapsed
time to the greatest accuracy within 6 display charac-
ters, including the unit character.  However the actual
solution time used for computing a submitter's total
time score as described above is always in seconds.

Informal contests derive timed scores without having
a single contest start time or giving out paper problem
descriptions.  In an informal contest a submitter gets
a problem named pppp by executing

	hpcm_get problems/pppp

This obtains a description of the problem as a file in
the submitter's directories.  One kind of informal
contest assigns each problem an individual start time
that is the time of the hpcm_get command that gets the
problem description.  The other kind of informal contest
is intended to closely simulate a formal contest but
allow each submitter to start at a different time.  In
this kind of informal contest, each submitter is assign-
ed a start time equal to the time the submitter first
gets a problem using hpcm_get, and then each solution of
that submitter is given this start time.

Untimed Contests
------- --------

When a scored contest is not of limited duration and
problems are not being timed, three different kinds of
submission may be allowed, and different penalties are
assigned for each kind of submission when that submis-
sion is incorrect.  The commands used to make the dif-
ferent kinds of submission and the penalties typically
assigned are:

	make submit		10%
	make in-submit		20%
	make inout-submit	30%

The first, `make submit', returns just the submission
score.  The second, `make in-submit', also returns the
judge's input for the first test case that was incor-
rect, provided the score was `Incorrect Output' or
`Formatting Error'.  The third, `make inout-submit',
returns both judge's input and judge's output for this
test case.

The score for each solution starts at 100.00, and is
multiplied by 90% for each incorrect `submit', 80% for
each incorrect `in-submit', and 70% for each incorrect
`inout-submit'.  Thus each penalty is applied to the re-
maining score for a problem.  Note that only incorrect
submissions before the first correct submission count.

A submitter's total score is the sum of the solution
scores for all problems solved by the submitter.

If incorrect submissions are being reported, solution
scores are not reported directly, but instead the number
of incorrect submissions are reported using the format
`IIiOOoXX'.  Here the upper case letter pairs denote
numbers and the lower case letters `i' and `o' appear
literally on the scoreboard.  II is the number of
`in-submit' incorrect submissions, OO the number of
`inout-submit' incorrect submissions, and XX the number
of `submit' incorrect submission.  If there are no in-
correct submissions, `100' is reported instead.

If incorrect submissions are NOT are being reported,
then the numeric score of the solution to the nearest
integer is reported.  Note, however, that in computing
the total score of a submitter, the solution score to
many decimal places is used.

Unscored Contests
-------- --------
If a contest is unscored, the entry for a problem
solution is just the date of the solution, followed by
`/N' if N is the total number of submissions up to and
including the first correct submission, provided that
incorrect submissions are being reported.
