Creating Windows with Xcsh
--------------------------

If your `terminal' is emulating an X terminal, to create
a new window you may use the command:

    xcsh    Start a new X terminal window running csh.

            The new window tends to form directly over
	    the top of the leftmost existing window, so
	    one of these windows has to be moved.

Xcsh takes options that change the font and location of
the window formed.  To try a different font, use the
command

    xcsh    PPm

where PP is the point size (e.g., 12, 16, 18, 24) de-
sired and `m' indicates you want a medium font.  This
command will list the available font names that begin
with PPm, and any of these can then be used as an option
to xcsh.  For example, if the command `xcsh 18m' outputs
`use one of 18ml 18ma 18mb', the command `xcsh 18ml'
would use an 18 point medium font of style `l'.

If you want a bold font, replace `m' in `PPm' by `b'.

To get more complete documentation of xcsh type the
command `xcsh -doc'.


Destroying a Window
---------- - ------

To destroy a window just type the command `exit', or if
that does not work, `logout'.

BUT BE CAREFUL not to destroy your original (root)
window as doing that may destroy all other windows.
