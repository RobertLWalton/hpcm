You may assume that input is correctly formatted, except
for the rare problem where you are told to produce
special output if the input contains a formatting error.
Do not waste time checking for input errors when you do
not have to.

In many problems newlines are NOT syntactically signifi-
cant, and newlines are just like any other space charac-
ter on input.

If you are writing in C you may need the ungetc func-
tion.

If you are writing in C++ you may need cin.peek().

If you are writing in PASCAL, you may want to use the
code in pascal/pascal.p for free-format input.
