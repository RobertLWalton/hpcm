Input Help		    Wed Nov  8 07:58:11 EST 2000

Input comes from the standard input.  This is `stdin' in
C, `cin' in C++, and `System.in' in JAVA.

You may assume that input is correctly formatted, except
for the rare problem where you are told to produce
special output if the input contains a formatting error.
Do not waste time checking for input errors when you do
not have to.

In many problems newlines are NOT syntactically signifi-
cant, and newlines are just like any other space charac-
ter on input.

If you are writing in C you may need the ungetc func-
tion.

If you are writing in C++ you may need cin.peek().

If you are writing in PASCAL, you may want to use the
code in demos/pascal/pascal.p for free-format input.
