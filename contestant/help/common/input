Input Help		    Fri Nov 17 06:10:11 EST 2000

Input comes from the standard input.  This is `stdin' in
C, `cin' in C++, and `System.in' in JAVA.  These input
streams do NOT have to be opened: you should NOT open
any files.

You may assume that input is correctly formatted, except
for the rare problem where you are told to produce
special output if the input contains a formatting error.
Do not waste time checking for input errors when you do
not have to.

In some problems newlines are NOT syntactically signifi-
cant, and newlines are just like any other space charac-
ter on input.

If you are writing in C you may need the ungetc func-
tion.

If you are writing in C++ you may need cin.peek().

If you are writing in PASCAL, you may want to use the
code in demos/pascal/pascal.p for free-format input.
