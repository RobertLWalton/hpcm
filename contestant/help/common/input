Input Help		    Mon Feb 18 05:15:48 EST 2002

Input comes from the standard input.  This is `stdin' in
C, `cin' in C++, `System.in' in JAVA, and *standard-
input* in COMMONLISP.  These input streams do NOT have to
be opened; you should NOT open any files.

You may assume that input is correctly formatted, except
for the rare problem where you are told to produce
special output if the input contains a formatting error.
Do not waste time checking for input errors when you do
not have to.

In some problems newlines are NOT syntactically signifi-
cant, and newlines are just like any other space charac-
ter on input.

If you are writing in C you may need the ungetc func-
tion and the gets function.

If you are writing in C++ you may need cin.peek() and
cin.getline(buffer, sizeof buffer).

If you are writing in PASCAL, you may want to use the
code in demos/pascal/pascal.p for free-format input.

If you are writing in COMMONLISP, you may need calls
like
	(read-line t nil 'eof)
	(read-char t nil 'eof)
	(peek-char nil t nil 'eof)
