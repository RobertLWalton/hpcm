API Documentation
--- ------------

JAVA API documentation is usually available on-line
during a contest.  The command to access it is:

	javahelp

You should NOT use other means to access such documenta-
tion, and in particular, using the internet typically
is a violation of contest rules.


Input
-----

Line oriented input is best done with

	java.io.BufferedReader.readLine
	java.util.StringTokenizer.getToken

An example is in the count1.java demo.  When using this
method, strings returned by getToken may have to be
converted to numbers.  This can be done by code such as

	String s = ...;
	int i = Integer.parseInt ( s );
	long l = Long.parseLong ( s );
	double d = Double.parseDouble ( s );

If line ends are to be treated just like space charac-
ters, using

	java.io.StreamTokenizer
	
is a good idea.  An example is in the javaio.java demo.


Output
------

Output of floating point numbers with a specified number
of decimal places is done with

	java.text.DecimalFormat

See the javaio.java demo.  It is important in some
contests to use a DecimalFormat object created with the
ENGLISH Locale.

Numbers that are output should NEVER have commas in
them, unless the problem specifically states otherwise.
This can be a problem if one uses NumberFormat.get_
instance and then fails to use applyPattern.

String and free format number output examples merely use

	System.out.println
	
and are given in the count1.java an javaio.java demos.


Crashes
-------

It is fairly common for JAVA programs which run well for
the contestant to crash when run by the judge.  The
usual cause is judge's input data that triggers an ex-
ception not observed with contestant input data.
Examples are when an out-of-range array index is used,
or the program one runs off the end of an input line
and calls getToken with no more tokens.  The best debug-
ging strategy is to try to find input data that breaks
the program.
