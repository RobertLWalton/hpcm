API Documentation
--- ------------

JAVA API documentation is usually available on-line
during a formal contest.  The command to access it is:

	javahelp

In a formal contest, you should NOT use other means to
access such documentation, as using the internet is a
violation of formal contest rules.


Program Structure
------- ---------

The next page has a suitable structure for a program
that solves a problem named PPPP that needs only line
input and character-within-line computations.

For a program that has free format input/output (line
feeds are sometimes treated as single space characters)
or has floating point output, a good option is to use
the demos/javaio/javaio.java file as a template, chang-
ing the name `javaio' to `PPPP' in both the file and
class name.  This program has input/output functions
that should make things much easier, unless input/output
is restricted to processing characters in lines.

It is fairly common for JAVA programs that run well for
the contestant to crash when run by the judge.  The
usual cause is judge's input data that triggers an ex-
ception not observed with contestant input data.  The
best debugging strategy is to try to find legal input
data that breaks the program, putting the data in the
PPPP.in file so your program will be run against it by
`make submit' and you will observe any crash.

    import java.io.*;

    public class PPPP {

	public static boolean debug;

	public static void dprintln ( String s )
	{
	    if ( debug ) System.out.println ( s );
	}

	public static void main (String[] args)
		throws IOException
	{

	    debug = ( args.length > 0 );

	    BufferedReader reader
	       = new BufferedReader
		     ( new InputStreamReader
			   ( System.in ) );

	    while ( true )
	    {

		String line = reader.readLine();
		if ( line == null ) break;

		. . .

		dprintln ( . . . );

		System.out.println ( . . . );
	    }
	}
    }
