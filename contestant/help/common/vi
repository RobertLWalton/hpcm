EDITORS:

    `nano' is self-documenting and the easiest to learn
           quickly.

    `vi' is used by many professional programmers and
         more dedicated programming contest contestants,
	 largely because it makes little use of the
	 shift and control keys.  This help file is a
	 quick tutorial in vi.

    `emacs' is more like a program development environ-
            ment and has its own embedded programming
	    language; start with `nano' which has the
	    flavor of a subset of `emacs' if you want
	    to learn emacs later.

SETUP: You should copy the following single line to your
       ~/.vimrc file.

set autoindent showmatch shiftwidth=4 mouse=a

    (Enter autoindent and showmatch modes; set shifwidth
     to 4; enable mouse.)
