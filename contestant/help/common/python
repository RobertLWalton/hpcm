The following is some code that may be useful:

import sys

# Set debug true if there are any arguments.
#
debug = ( len ( sys.argv ) > 1 )

# Read a line and return the line without any ending
# line feed, or return None if an end of file was found
# instead of a line.
#
def read():
    try:
        result = raw_input().rstrip ( '\n' )
    except EOFError:
        result = None
    finally:
        return result

# Print if debug on.
#
def dprintf (format_arg, *args):
    global debug
    if debug:
        print format_arg.format ( * args )

# Split line read into a vector of whitespace separated
# items.
#
items = line.split()

# Convert item to floating point number:
#
number = float ( item[4] )
