C Language Program Structure 
- -------- ------- ---------

Typical program structure including end of file detect-
ion, finding symbols such as `*' that end a string of
numbers, and debugging is:

    /* Standard Libraries.  */

    #include <stdlib.h>  /* qsort */
    #include <stdio.h>   /* scanf, fgets, printf */

    /* String and character computation. */

    #include <string.h>  /* strcmp, strcpy, ...   */
    #include <ctype.h>   /* isalpha, islower, ... */

    /* Math and Number Limits. */

    #include <math.h>    /* M_PI, atan2, ...      */
    #include <limits.h>  /* INT_MIN, INT_MAX, ... */
    #include <float.h>   /* DBL_MIN, DBL_MAX      */

    /* Debugging. */

    #include <assert>    /* assert */

    int debug;
    #define dprintf if ( debug ) printf

    char line[82];
	/* You can assume lines longer than 80 charac-
	 * ters will not be read by `fgets' below,
	 * UNLESS the problem statement says otherwise.
	 * You need 1 extra character for the '\n'
	 * and another extra character for the '\0'.
	 */

    int main ( int argc, char * argv[] )
    {
	/* argc == number of program arguments + 1.  */

	debug = ( argc > 1 );
	. . . .
	while ( fgets ( line, sizeof ( line ), stdin ) )
	{
	    /* Print test case name. */

	    printf ( "%s", line );

	    /* Read input. */

	    scanf ( ... );
	    . . . . .
	    /* Read a string of integers ending in `*'.
	     */
	    while ( scanf ( "%d", ... ) != 0 )
	    {
	       . . . . .
	    }

	    /* Skip `*' and preceding whitespace. */

	    scanf ( " *" );
	    . . . . .

	    /* After reading test case data with scanf,
	     * input will be just before the line feed
	     * at the end of the test case data.  This
	     * must be skipped or else it will be
	     * erroneously read as an empty next test
	     * case name.  Note: you CANNOT use
	     * scanf ("\n") to do this! */

	    fgets ( line, sizeof ( line ), stdin );
		/* The line read here consists of just a
		 * line feed and is discarded. */

	    /* Compute. */

	    dprintf ( ... );  /* Print if debug.
	    . . . . .

	    /* Output. */

	    printf ( ... );
	}

	/* Return 0 from `main' to tell system there
	 * is no error.
	 */
	return 0;

    }


Occasionally one has a conflict with some name defined
in the `#include's.  E.g., you may have trouble naming a
global variable `time'.   To fix this, change the name
of your variable.  A simple way of doing this is to put
the following right after the `#include's:

	#define time Time


Input
-----

Input is read from the standard input; you MUST NOT open
any file for input.

Test cases begin with a test case name line that is
read by the first `fgets'.  `fgets' returns NULL on an
end of file, which is interpreted as `false', so the
outer loop above processes one test case at a time.  As
soon as the test case name is successfully read into
`line', it is printed by `printf ( "%s", line )'.  All
test case name lines are 80 characters or less, so
`line' as enough room for 80 characters plus the line
ending '\n' and then the string ending '\0', both of
which are supplied by `fgets'.

After reading and printing the test case name line, the
rest of the test case data is read with `scanf'.  This
data may consist of numbers, perhaps with a few
characters like `*' thrown in to indicate the end of a
sequence of numbers.  The lines containing numbers may
be very long, so they should be read one number at a
time with `scanf', and NOT read in first with `fgets'.
A `*' may be detected by looking at the return value
of `scanf', which is the number of numbers actually
read.  If you are expecting 4 integers or a `*', use
`scanf ( "%d%d%d%d", ... )' which returns 4 if it read
4 integers and 0 if it encountered a `*'.  Then in the
latter case you must skip the `*', which can be done
by `scanf ( " *" )' which skips first the whitespace
between the last number read and the input `*', and
then skips the input `*'.

See demos/c/summer for a demonstration problem that
reads numbers.

Floating point numbers can be read by `scanf' by using
%lf instead of %d, and non-numbers can be read by using
%s or %c - see synopsis below.  Sometimes a problem will
specifically ask you to read lines to be processed as
character strings, in which case use `fgets' and be sure
your line buffer is long enough.

On some problems there are no test case name lines but
instead each test case has one input line containing
text and one output line containing text.  For these
the test case input line is read the same way as the
test case name line is read above.

See demos/c/reverser for a demonstration problem that
reads text lines.


Output
------

Output is written to the standard output; you MUST NOT
open any file for output; you MUST NOT write to the
standard error output.

Output can be written with printf.  Some formats that
may be useful are "%.3f" to print a double with exactly
3 decimal places in as few columns as possible, "%10.3f"
to print the double right adjusted in 10 columns, "%10s"
to print a string right adjusted in 10 columns, and
"%-10s" to print a string LEFT adjusted in 10 columns.
Here the numbers 3 and 10 are merely representative, and
can be replaced by any other non-zero positive integers.

See demos/c/summer for a demonstation that outputs
floating point `double's.


Debugging
---------

When your program is executed by the judge, it will
NOT be passed ANY arguments.  A standard debugging
technique is to output extra debugging information if
and only if your program is passed an argument.

The above program defines `debug' to be true if and
only if the program is called with one or more argu-
ments, and defines dprintf to do what printf does if
and only if `debug' is true.  Thus dprintf can be used
to print debugging information.

Debugging is best done with information printed by
`dprintf', and not with a debugger like `gdb'.  The
exception is debugging programs that crash or go into
an infinite loop, which is best done with a debugger
like `gdb'.  See `help gdb' for how to use `gdb' on
programs that crash or go into an infinite loop.

It is also a good idea to use `assert' statements
to check that assumptions you have made are valid during
actual program execution.  For example, if you are
certain that scanf should read 3 integers, then instead
of writing

	scanf ( "%d%d%d", ... );

it might be better to write

	assert ( scanf ( "%d%d%d", ... ) == 3 );

Similarly, you could replace `scanf ( " *" )' in the
above code by

	assert ( scanf ( " %c", line[0] ) == 1 );
	assert ( line[0] == '*' );

See the demos/c/summer demonstration solution for a
simple example uses of dprintf and assert.


Function and Macro Specifications
-------- --- ----- --------------

You can get full documentation of the functions
mentioned above plus other useful information by using
the UNIX commands:

	man scanf
	man fgets
	man 3 printf
	man assert
	man math.h
	man limits.h
	man float.h

The following is an extract from `man' pages of the
details needed to use the functions mentioned above,
and also a few numeric constants.  Here we assume you
already know something about how to use `scanf' and
`printf', so we do not have to explain them from
scratch.

Note that an `int' is guaranteed to be at least 32 bits
and a `long long int' is guaranteed to be at least 64
bits.  Floating point computations should always be done
using `double's, and NOT `float's, to avoid having too
little precision.

int scanf ( const char * format, ... )

    Format can contain the following directives:

    %d		First skips whitespace.  Then if this is
    		followed by non-whitespace with the
		format of an `int', reads the `int'.

    %lld	Ditto but for `long long int' instead of
    		`int'.

    %lf		Ditto but for `double' instead of `int'.

    %s		Ditto but for a string of non-whitespace
    		characters, instead of `int'.

    %c		Scans a single character.  Does NOT skip
    		preceding whitespace.

    whitespace	Skips any amount of whitespace, includ-
    		ing none.  Line feeds are whitespace in
		this sense.

    other	Skips just the given character.  E.g.,
    character	if `*' is in the format, then `*' must
    		be next in the input if the input is to
		move forward.  If you want to skip
		whitespace followed by `*', you MUST put
		" *" and NOT just "*" in the format.

    Scanf returns the number of items successfully read
    by %... format directives.  Thus if you are expect-
    ing either a float or a `*', `scanf ( "%lf", ... )'
    will return 1 if a number was found and read, or 0
    if a `*' was found and NOT read.  Note that if it
    returns 0 it will have skipped the whitespace before
    the `*', so the `*' will be next.


char * fgets ( char * buffer, sizeof ( buffer ), stdin )

    Read characters from the standard input into the
    buffer until a line feed is read and stored, and
    then store a '\0' in the buffer.  If there are NO
    characters to be read because we are at the end of
    file, return NULL, which can be interpreted as
    `false'; otherwise return the address of the buffer,
    which can be interpreted as `true'.

    Note: `fgets' as it is used above is equivalent to
    `gets ( buffer )', but the `gets' function has been
    `deprecated', meaning that implementations need not
    and eventually will not support it.


int printf ( const char * format, ... )

    Format can contain the following directives, in
    in which W and P stand for sequences of decimal
    digits, where W is used for `widths' and P for
    `precisions':

    %d		Outputs an `int' as a decimal integer
    		with no spaces before or after.

    %Wd		Outputs an `int' as a decimal integer
    		right adjusted in W columns.

    %lld	Outputs a `long long int' as a decimal
    		integer with no spaces before or after.

    %Wlld	Outputs a `long long int' as a decimal
    		integer right adjusted in W columns.

    %f		Outputs a `double' as a floating point
    		number with 6 decimal places and no
		spaces before or after.

    %.Pf	Ditto but with P decimal places instead
    		of 6 decimal places.

    %Wf		Outputs a `double' as a floating point
    		number with 6 decimal places right
		adjusted in W columns.

    %W.Pf	Ditto but with P decimal places instead
    		of 6 decimal places.

    %s		Outputs a `const char *' or `char *'
    		string with no spaces before or after.

    %Ws		Ditto but outputs the string RIGHT
    		adjusted in W columns.

    %-Ws	Ditto but outputs the string LEFT
    		adjusted in W columns.

    %c		Outputs a `char' as an ASCII character
    		with no spaces before or after.
    		

INT_MAX, INT_MIN, LLONG_MAX, LLONG_MIN, DBL_MAX, DBL_MIN

    These are the maximum and minimum numbers that can
    be stored respectively in an `int', `long long int',
    or `double'.  The integer values are from `limits.h'
    and the floating point values from `float.h'.

M_PI, M_E

    The mathematical constants PI and e from math.h.
