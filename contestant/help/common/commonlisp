Commonlisp
----------

There is no reasonably standard COMMONLISP, so HPCM
hides the exact commonlisp it is using inside the
hpcm_clisp program.  The standard way of running a
COMMONLISP solution interpretively is

    hpcm_clisp -I pppp.lsp

This loads pppp.lsp into the interpreter and issues the
`(main)' call.  The programmer should write a `(defun
main ...)' for a function that reads `*terminal-io*'
and writes `*terminal-io*'.  The output of this
command is just what the `main' function writes to the
`*terminal-io*', and nothing more.

WARNING: you must use *terminal-io* and NOT *standard-
input/output*.  Thus you should use things like

	(format t ...)
	(read-line t ...)

The pppp.lsp file can be compiled via the command

    hpcm_clisp -c pppp.lsp

and the compiled code can then be executed by

    hpcm_clisp -I pppp.fas


Program Structure
------- ---------

The following can be used as the structure of a pppp.lsp
file:

    (defvar debug)
    (defun dformat (&rest r)
	(if debug (apply #'format t r)))

    (defun main (&rest r)
      (setq debug r)

      (loop
	(let ( (line (read-line t nil 'eof)) )
	  (if (eq line 'eof) (return))

	  (dformat "..." . . .)

	  . . . ))

       (format t "..." . . .))

If the program is called with one or more arguments, the
`debug' defvar is set non-nil, and `(dformat ...)' will
do nothing.  The program can be called with arguments
by executing

    hpcm_clisp -I pppp.fas argument ...

The `(read-line t nil 'eof)' expression will read a line
and return it, but return the symbol eof if an end of
file is encountered instead of a line.
