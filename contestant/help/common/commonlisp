Commonlisp
----------

There is no reasonably standard COMMONLISP, so HPCM
hides the exact commonlisp it is using inside the
hpcm_clisp program.  The standard way of running a
COMMONLISP solution interpretively is

    hpcm_clisp -I pppp.lsp

This loads pppp.lsp into the interpreter and issues the
`(main)' call.  The programmer should write a `(defun
main ...)' for a function that reads `*standard-input*'
and writes `*standard-output*'.  The output of this
command is just what the `main' function writes to the
standard output, and nothing more.

The pppp.lsp file can be compiled via the command

    hpcm_clisp -c pppp.lsp

and the compiled code can then be executed by

    hpcm_clisp -I pppp.fas
