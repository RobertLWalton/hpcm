Reading Mail		    Sat Oct 19 02:30:16 EDT 2013


You receive mail in your `postoffice' which is read with
the `mail' command.  When you exit `mail', all the
messages you read are copied to `~/mbox', which may be
read with the `mail -f ~/mbox' command.  Messages you
did not read are left in the postoffice.

The most common `mail' commands are:

    h	Display a directory of messages.
    #	Read message # (# is a message number), and
        make this the current message.  Also see
        info on reading long messages below.
    n	Read the next message.
    p	Re-read the current message (print)
    q   Quit.
    x   Quit but do NOT move messages from the
        postoffice to ~/mbox
    h#  Display the screenfull portion of the directory
        of messages that contains message number #,
	for use with large directories.
    ?   Display list of all possible commands.

If you read a long message, `--More--' will appear at
the bottom of the screen.  At this point the common
commands are

    Enter	Display next line.
    Space	Display next screen full of lines.
    q		Quit reading the message.
    ?		Display list of possible commands.
