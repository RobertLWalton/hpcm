Results Come by Email:
---------------------

You will get your results back by e-mail.  Correct
results will also be posted on the scoreboard (see
below).

Whatever you submit (or send by hcpm_sendmail, see
below) will be Cc'ed to your account.
  

Asking Questions:
----------------

You may e-mail questions to the judges but the method
is a little weird.  First, edit your email in a file
of your own choosing.  If your first line has the
form

	Subject: ....

and the next line is completely empty (no spaces),
then the first line will be the subject line of the
message.  Then

	hpcm_sendmail < filename

to send the file as email to the judges.

If you ask for a clarification by e-mail, and a signifi-
cant answer is given, that answer will be given by post-
ing it on the scoreboard so everyone can see it.  You
will not receive email back in this case.



What Do the Scores Mean
---- -- --- ------ ----

Scoring is done by running the judge's input through
your program to produce `your output', which is compared
with the `judge's output', that is produced by running
the judge's solution on the same input.  With this in
mind, the possible scores and their more precise mean-
ings are as follows:

Completely Correct
    Your output was essentially the same as the judge's
    output.  For some problems, `essentially the same'
    means exactly the same, character by character.  For
    problems with floating point numeric output, numbers
    may not differ by more than a tolerance specified in
    the problem description.
    
    If the number of columns occupied by numbers and
    other output is specified by the problem descrip-
    tion, then numbers are required to end in the cor-
    rect column, even when they differ.  If the number
    of decimal places in output numbers are is speci-
    fied, your numbers and the judge's numbers must have
    the same number of decimal places.  If the presence
    or absence of exponents in output numbers is speci-
    fied, your numbers must agree with the judge's
    numbers on having or not having an exponent.  The
    absence of an exponent is implicit if an absolute
    number tolerance is specified, such as 0.001; but
    specification of a relative number tolerance, such
    as 0.01%, implies that exponents are optional.

    If white spaces in the output are specified by the
    problem description, no extra spaces are allowed and
    no required spaces may be missing.  Most problem
    descriptions specify the number of lines to be out-
    put, in which case no extra blank lines may be
    output and no required blank or empty lines may be
    missing.

    `Completely Correct' is the ONLY score that means
    your solution was accepted by the judges, and you
    have solved the problem.  All other scores mean your
    solution has been rejected by the judges.

Formatting Error
    Your output has the right symbols and the right num-
    bers (within any designated tolerance) in the right
    order, but there are unallowed differences in white-
    space, columnization, letter case, number of decimal
    places in numbers, or presence or absence of expo-
    nents in numbers.  These differences can be as
    little as one extra blank line in your output!

Incomplete Output
    Your output is not empty, and is either completely
    correct or has only formatting errors, but your out-
    put stops prematurely.

Cpu Time Limit Exceeded
    The program was terminated by the system because
    it exceeded the CPU time limit imposed by the
    problem Makefile.

Output Size Limit Exceeded
    The program was terminated by the system because
    it exceeded the amount of output allowed by the
    problem Makefile.

Program Crashed
    Your program did not produce any output, or your
    program sent output to the standard error stream,
    or your program terminated abnormally; but your
    program did not exceed either CPU time or output
    size limits.  Exceeding memory limits will cause
    this score, because it is unfortunately difficult
    to distinguish memory limit exceedments from other
    kinds of program crashes (e.g., using unallocated
    memory).

Incorrect Output
    The program did not crash and was not terminated,
    and some symbol or number in your output did not
    match the corresponding symbol or number in the
    judge's output, even when letter case is ignored
    and number differences within any tolerance stated
    in the problem description are ignored.


The Scoreboard
--------------

If you do not have a contest account provided by the
contest judges, you will typically have been given a web
URL at which a one page contest scoreboard is displayed.

But in a contest account provided by the contest judges
the scoreboard is best displayed by allocating a
separate window to show the scoreboard and in that
window running the command:

    scoreboard

	This command will show the contest scoreboard
	refreshing every 30 seconds.  The command is
	best executed in its own window.  To terminate
	type ^C.

	The scoreboard has several pages.  The score-
	board command cycles through the pages, going to
	the next page every 30 seconds.  The command:

		scoreboard n

	just displays the n'th page, refreshing every
	30 seconds.

The command `help scoreboard' will display a description
of the scoreboard format.

The part of the scoreboard that shows team scores may
not available during the last hour of a formal contest.
This is done to create suspense so people will come to
the post-contest meeting.

At the end of a formal contest the final results will be
announced in a post-contest meeting, as soon as the
final submissions have been judged.
