Results Come by Email:
---------------------

You will get your results back by e-mail.  Correct
results will also be posted on the scoreboard (see
below).

Whatever you submit (or send by hcpm_sendmail, see
below) will be Cc'ed to your account.


Asking Questions:
----------------

You may e-mail questions to the judges but the method
is a little weird.  First, edit your email in a file
of your own choosing.  If your first line has the
form

	Subject: ....

and the next line is completely empty (no spaces),
then the first line will be the subject line of the
message.  Then

	hpcm_sendmail < filename

to send the file as email to the judges.

If you ask for a clarification by e-mail, and a signifi-
cant answer is given, that answer will be given by post-
ing it on the scoreboard so everyone can see it.  You
will not receive email back in this case.


The Scoreboard
--------------

If you do not have a contest account provided by the
contest judges, you will typically have been given a web
URL at which a one page contest scoreboard is displayed.

But in a contest account provided by the contest judges
the scoreboard is best displayed by allocating a
separate window to show the scoreboard and in that
window running the command:

    scoreboard

	This command will show the contest scoreboard
	refreshing every 30 seconds.  The command is
	best executed in its own window.  To terminate
	type ^C.

	The scoreboard has several pages.  The score-
	board command cycles through the pages, going to
	the next page every 30 seconds.  The command:

		scoreboard n

	just displays the n'th page, refreshing every
	30 seconds.

The command `help scoreboard' will display a description
of the scoreboard format.

The part of the scoreboard that shows team scores may
not available during the last hour of a formal contest.
This is done to create suspense so people will come to
the post-contest meeting.

At the end of a formal contest the final results will be
announced in a post-contest meeting, as soon as the
final submissions have been judged.
