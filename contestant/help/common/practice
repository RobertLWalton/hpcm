Practice Problems
-------- --------

Some contests have practice problems in addition to
regular contest problems.  Practice problems are just
like regular contest problems except:

(1) Practice problems do NOT count in scoring the
    contest and do NOT show up on the contest
    scoreboard.

(2) Practice problems may be done DURING OR BEFORE the
    contest.

(3) Contest management may help teams with ANY aspect of
    a practice problem, including details of algorithm
    selection, design, and coding.

The practice problem set is on the contest web page.

If a contest has practice problems the following
commands can be used:

    practice print
        Prints the practice problems.

    practice scoreboard
        Outputs a scoreboard containing just the
	practice problems, in the same way that the
	`scoreboard' command outputs the normal
	contest scoreboard.

Practice problems are solved and submitted in the same
way that normal problems are solved and submitted, and
their scores are returned in e-mail in the same way as
the scores of normal problems are returned.  The
`hpcm_get' command gets practice problems whenever it
is executed.

If the input and output of the first failed test case is
being returned by the autojudge for the easiest normal
problems, this will also be done for practice problems.
