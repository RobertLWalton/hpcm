Read the Demonstration Problems
---- --- ------------- --------

Every contest has rules for how to write your solution
programs; e.g., rules for submitting files, rules for
doing input and output, etc.  The best way to BE SURE
you are following these rules is to read a demonstration
problem solution in the language you are using, and
mimic that solution when you do input/output, submit
your files, etc.


Input/Output Difficulties
-------------------------

A surprising number of solutions have simple bugs in
input or output.  You need to master these with a bit
of practice.  For example, be sure you can detect
the end of file and not go into an infinite loop when
it happens. 


Completeness
------------

Many times solutions are correct except that their
author ignored one smallish instruction in the problem
statement.   You need to test that your solution meets
EVERY stipulation in the problem statement.  There is
no partial credit in a contest like this.


In a Formal Contest Do the Easiest Problems First
-------------------------------------------------

Take great care to do easiest problems first.  Your
primary score is the number of completely correct prob-
lems you have done.  In the event of a tie, your lowest-
best secondary score is the sum of the number of minutes
you took for each problem, where the minutes for a prob-
lem are computed by subtracting the start time of the
contest from the submit time of the problem.  In effect,
if you do N problems, the time you take on the first
problem counts N times, the time on the second N-1
times, etc.  Sorry, but these are just the standard
rules.

Be sure you can handle the formatting issues of a prob-
lem before you attempt it.


Formal Contest Goals
--------------------

You should try hard to complete half the problems.  
Often completing a bit more than half the problems is
sufficient to be one of the several contest `winners'
(i.e. to go on to the next round).
