The following is useful in a formal contest setting, but
not so much in an informal contest.

Do Easiest Problems First
-------------------------

Take great care to do easiest problems first.  Your
primary score is the number of completely correct prob-
lems you have done.  In the event of a tie, your lowest-
best secondary score is the sum of the number of minutes
you took for each problem, where the minutes for a prob-
lem are computed by subtracting the start time of the
contest from the submit time of the problem.  In effect,
if you do N problems, the time you take on the first
problem counts N times, the time on the second N-1
times, etc.  Sorry, but these are just the standard
rules.

Be sure you can handle the formatting issues of a prob-
lem before you attempt it.

Goals
-----

You should try hard to complete half the problems.  
Often completing a bit more than half the problems is
sufficient to be one of the several contest `winners'
(i.e. to go on to the next round).
