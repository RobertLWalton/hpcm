In an ACM contest the contest staff will bring your
printouts to you, and you are NOT permitted to fetch
them from the printer yourself.  The `printer' command
below may tell you something about the status of your
printout.

In non-ACM contests you have to define your printer
yourself in the ~/PRINTER file of your account: see
below for details.

	the `help xxx' command.

    printer

	Shows the printer status for an ACM contest.


Printer Definition for non-ACM Contests
------- ---------- --- ------- --------

In non-ACM contests, you have to define your printer by
putting its name in the ~/PRINTER file in your contest
account.   The name of the printer can be an email
address, in which case postscript files will be emailed
to that address, instead of being sent directly to a
printer.

If ~/PRINTER contains an email address, postscript files
will be the bodies of the messages mailed.  But if
~/PRINTER contains an email address preceded by an
initial `@' (so ~/PRINTER has a line with two `@'s) then
the postscript files will be attachments in the messages
mailed.


Using Linux/MAC Procmail for non-ACM Contests
----- --------- -------- --- ------- --------

If postscript files are being emailed in message bodies
to an address like `fee<fi@fo>' on a system that uses
`procmail' (e.g., Linux, MAC), one typically puts the
following entry in the `.procmailrc' file of the `fi@fo'
account:

	:0 b
	* ^To:[ 	]+fee<fi
	| lpr -Plp

This pipes the body of any email received with a `To'
address of `fee<fi...' to `lpr -Plp'.  Here the []'s
contain a space followed by a tab.
