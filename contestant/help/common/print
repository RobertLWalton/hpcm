In a formal contest the contest staff will bring your
printouts to you.  In an informal contest you will have
to go get them yourself.

Printer Commands:
----------------

    print filename ...

	Prints files with 80 column width.

    print2 filename ...

	Prints files with 80 column width using a more
	compact two pages per page format and very
	small font.
