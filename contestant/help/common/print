In a formal contest the contest staff will bring your
printouts to you.  The lpq command below may tell you
something about the status of your printout.

In an informal contest run at a particular location and
time, your printer may be defined for you, but you will
have to go get your printouts yourself.  Otherwise, in
informal contests you typically have to define your
printer yourself in the ~/PRINTER file or your account:
see below for details.

Printer Commands:
----------------

    print filename ...

	Prints files with 80 column width.

    print2 filename ...

	Prints files with 80 column width using a more
	compact two pages per page format and very
	small font.

    fprint filename ...

	Ditto but assumes 56 column width and uses a
	normal sized font.  All our documentation and
	sample code is written with a 56 column width
	(and where appropriate, a 40 line per page
	length).

    lpq

	Shows the printer status.


Printer Definition in Informal Contests
------- ---------- -- -------- --------

In an informal contest you typically have to define your
printer by putting its name in the ~/PRINTER file in
your account.   The name of the printer can be an email
address, in which case postscript files will be emailed
to that address, instead of being sent to a normal
printer.

If postscript files are being emailed to an address like
`fee<fi@fo>' on a system that uses `procmail' (e.g.,
Linux), one typically puts the following entry in the
`.procmailrc' file of the `fi@fo' account:

	:0 b
	* ^To:[ 	]+fee<fi
	| lpr -Plp

This pipes the body of any email received with a `To'
address of `fee<fi...' to `lpr -Plp'.  Here the []'s
contain a space followed by a tab.
