Fixed Width Output
------------------

The following is useful for producing fixed width format
numbers.

To output a right adjusted integer I in N columns use:

		cout << setw (N) << I;

Setw sets the width of the next output; but each output
resets this to 0 so you must reset the width just before
outputting each N column number.  The width of 0 means
`use as many columns as necessary'.

To output a right adjusted floating point number F in N
columns with P decimal places use:

    cout << setiosflags ( ios::showpoint | ios::fixed);
    cout << setprecision (P);
    cout << setw (N) << F;

The precision P and flags do not get reset after the
number is output.  They can be reset to defaults by

   cout << resetiosflags ( ios::showpoint | ios::fixed);
   cout << setprecision (6);

To use setw etc. you need to:

    #include <iomanip.h>

What May Not Work
-----------------

You should NOT try to use C++ templates or exceptions.
Features like these are not yet standardized across C++
compilers, and we have little faith in the ability of
our compiler to handle them sufficiently correctly
(templates mostly work, but ... ).

The `bool' data type does work, however.
