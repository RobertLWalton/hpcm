Output Help		    Mon Feb 18 05:17:44 EST 2002

Output is written to the standard output.  This is
`stdout' in C, `cout' in C++, `System.out' in JAVA, and
`*standard-output*' in COMMONLISP.  These output streams
do NOT have to be opened; you should NOT open any files.

In general, to be correct your program must produce
EXACTLY the one and only correct sequence of output
characters.

The only whitespace characters you should use are new-
line and the single space ' ', unless the problem de-
scription contains explicit instructions to use hori-
zontal tabs.

You should never use two single spaces in a row unless
explicitly instructed to do so.  Usually the only time
you use two spaces in a row is when you are asked to
line things up in columns.

You should never put space characters at the beginning
or ending of lines unless explicitly instructed to do so
(which is never, except for beginning spaces to line
something up in a column).

You must use the correct upper or lower case.

The judging is done by comparing your program's output
to a judge's solution's output on specially prepared
judge's input.  The comparison checks for differences
in column position of non-numeric non-blank characters
and the ends of numbers, and checks the differences
of numbers.  The comparison is likely to require an
EXACT match for output that does not include floating
point numbers, and an EXACT match except for numbers
when floating point numbers are included.  BEWARE.

To format floating point numbers within a fixed number
of columns, you should use formats like %10.6f in C,
:10:6 in PASCAL, and ~10,6F in COMMONLISP.  See the
help file on C++ for information on how to write fixed
width floating point numbers in C++.

If you are asked to output floating point numbers but
are NOT given the number of columns in which to place
the number, you may assume that the number of columns
occupied by the number is unimportant.  This is because
numbers that are only slightly different may take dif-
ferent numbers of columns: e.g., 10.000 and 9.999 where
the accuracy is supposed to be 0.001 and the true value
might be close to 9.9995.
