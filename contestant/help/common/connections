Connections
-----------

Sometimes internet connections crash and need to be
remade.  Here are two methods of combating this.

Keep Alive
---- -----

Some networks will break a TCP connection if it is not
used for a while.  Try adding

ServerAliveInterval 120

to your ~/.ssh/config file.  Windows emulators for MS
machines also have a this parameter under another name
defaulting to 0, which disables it.  The parameter
sends a keep-alive message over the TCP connection every
120 seconds.


Screen
------

The screen program allows you to make one or more ses-
sions which do NOT die when you become disconnected, but
can be resumed.  The commands are:

    screen
        Use this at any time to start a new screen
	session.  The new screen overlays your current
	window, and behaves like a VT100 terminal
	emulator

    control-A d
        When in a screen session, this detaches the
	session, stopping it but preserving it for
	later restart.

    screen -r
        Reattach a detached session.  If there is more
	than one, a list of them is printed instead.

    screen -r #
        Reattach detached session number #.  Used if
	there is more than one detached session.

    screen -d
        Detach an attached session.  If there is more
	than one, a list of them is printed instead.

    screen -d #
        Detach attached session number #.  Used if
	there is more than one attached session.

    exit
        Exit the current session and destroy it.

If your TCP (network) connection is closed by some
intermediate network router, your screen session auto-
matically detaches, but does not die.
