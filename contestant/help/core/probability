Probabilities
-------------

Probabilities are ratios of unbounded counts.

Suppose we have an experiment that we can run over and
over again, and which has N possible outcomes, o1, o2,
..., oN.  Think of an N-sided die that can be thrown
over and over again.

Suppose that after the first M repetitions of the
experiment (e.g., die throws) the number of times each
outcome has been observed are c1, c2, ..., cN, respec-
tively.  Then we look at the ratios

	p1 = c1/M, p2 = c2/M, ..., pN = cN/M

and see how these ratios change as we keep repeating
the experiment and increasing M.  If these ratios tend
to converge to particular numbers that we call `limits',
we say that these limits are the `probabilities' of the
outcomes, and write p1, p2, ..., pN to denote these
limits, i.e., these probabilities.

So for example, if the experiment consists of throwing
a normal 6-sided dice, we might expect all the outcome
probabilities to converge to 1/6, so we get

	p1 = p2 = p3 = p4 = p5 = p6 = 1/6

But things might not be thus, so let us look at what
else might happen.

One possibility is that the ratios converge but not
to equal values, so maybe

    p1 = 5/60, p2 = 15/60, p3 = p4 = p5 = p6 = 10/60

in which case throwing a 1 is less likely than one
would expect and throwing a 2 more likely.  In this
case the probabilities are still well defined, but
they differ from what we expected.  For dice we say
that a die is `unbiased' if all the probabilities
are equal, and `biased' if they are not.  Gamblers
may try to cheat by using biased dice which they
falsely claim are unbiased, for example.

The other possibility is the that ratios do NOT con-
verge to particular numbers, but tend to wander about
over a range of values as M, the number of experiments
(e.g., die throws) increases.  Then the probabilities
are UNDEFINED.  For example, you are gambling with a
cheater who has magnetised the die and put an electro-
magnet under the table which he controls with a foot
switch.  You can say if you like that there is an
external factor, the switch position, that affects the
probabilities, but if you don't know what the external
factors are, and they keep changing while you repeat
the experiment, then all you see is ratios that refuse
to converge.


Activities and Events
---------- --- ------

We are going to make an important change in terminology.

First, instead of an `experiment' we are going to talk
about an `activity'.  Second, instead of an `outcome'
we are going to talk about an `event' that happens
during the activity.

For example, suppose the activity consists of throwing
a 6-sided die TWICE.  Some events in this are:

   1.	Throwing a 1 with the first throw.
   .1	Throwing a 1 with the second throw.
   12   Throwing a 1 with the first throw and then
   	throwing 2 with the second throw.
   ij	Throwing an i with the firs throw and a j with
        the second throw, where 1 <= i,j <= 6.
   ==	Throwing the same number with both throws.

Note that

  1. is the union of 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16.
  .1 is the union of 11, 21, 31, 41, 51, and 61.
  == is the union of 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, and 66.

Now to define probabilities one must repeat the activity
a very large number of times.  We generally do NOT talk
about this, and merely imply it.  We assume the activity
is repeatable in principal, though usually it is not
repeated in practice.

Furthermore, we assume that if we did repeat the
activity, then the probability ratios will converge to
limits.  Thus if cE is the number of times event E
happens when repeating the activity M times, we assume
that pE = cE/M converges to a limit, and we call this
limit the probability of event E in the activity.
