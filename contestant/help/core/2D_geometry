PLANAR GEOMETRY PROBLEM HELP
			    Fri Aug 17 22:28:35 EDT 2001

For some reason many young computer scientists think
that geometry problems are hard, and avoid them.  Its
the purpose of this blurb to demonstrate that geometry
problems are easy after all.

We will restrict ourselves here to planar geometry.

Let
	p = (px,py) and q = (qx,qy)
	
be points in the plane.  The difference

	v = (vx,vy) = p - q = (px-qx,py-qy)
	
is the vector from p to q.  Its length is

	|v| = sqrt( vx**2 + vy** 2 )

The scalar product of two vectors

	u = (ux,uy) and v = (vx,vy)

is

	u.v = ux*vx + uy*vy

	    = |u| |v| cos theta

where theta is the angle between u and v (the sign of
theta does not matter because cos theta = cos -theta).
Note that

	|v| = sqrt (v.v)

A clockwise rotation R(theta) of a vector v=(vx,vy) by
an angle theta is

	             |   cos theta    sin theta | | vx |
	R(theta).v = |                          | |    |
	             | - sin theta    cos theta | | vy |

	      | vx cos theta + vy sin theta |
	    = |                             |
	      | vx sin theta - vy cos theta |

Most particularly, if theta = 90 degrees, then

		
	                |  0   1 |
	R(90 degrees) = |        |
	                | -1   0 |


        R(90 degrees).v =  (vy,-vx)

These are all the basics you need to know.


Lines Dividing Planes
----- -------- ------

The line through points p and q, oriented in the
direction from p to q (p != q is assumed), divides the
plane into three parts: points to the right of the
line (facing in the direction from p to q), points to
the left of the line, and points on the line.  How do
we find out whether a point r is to the right, left,
or on the line?

Simply compute:

    v = R(90 degrees).(q-p) = (qy-py,-qx+px)

    Note: then v.q = v.p.

    if v.r > v.p then r is to the right of the line;
    if v.r < v.p then r is to the left of the line;
    if v.r == v.p then r is on the line.

Intersection
------------

    Suppose we are given four points, p1, p2, q1, q2.
    Question: does the interior of the line from p1 to
    p2 intersect the interior of the line from q1 to q2.

    Answer: it does iff the line from p1 to p2 splits
    q1 and q2, and the line from q1 to q2 splits p1 and
    p2, where for a line to split two points means that
    one point must be to the right of the line and the
    other point must be to the left of the line.  Note
    that necessarily p1 != p2 and q1 != q2, as otherwise
    at least one line would not be defined.
