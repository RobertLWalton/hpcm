Email UNIX Tools Help	    Sun Nov 19 05:18:51 EST 2000

Before you read this file, read the `help/email_contest'
file up to the section in that file entitled `Getting
Started on a Non-UNIX System'.

Getting Started in a UNIX System
------- ------- -- - ---- ------

To get started, send email to the email address of the
autojudge with the subject `get help' and an empty mes-
sage body.  The reply will contain many files (including
the file you are now reading).

Copy this reply into the file named help.email in your
home directory.  Manually extract the file hpcm_extract
from this help.email file into your home directory.

In the following we assume that you want all the files
dealing with HPCM (Harvard Programming Contest Manager)
contests in your directory `~/hpcm', where `~' denotes
your home directory.  An alternative is to put the three
subdirectories of `~/hpcm', namely `help', `demos', and
`problems', directly in your home directory.  To do this
read the section titled `Using Your Home Directory as
Your HPCM Directory' at the end of this document NOW.

Assuming you want all HPCM files in `~/hpcm', next exe-
cute the following UNIX commands with your home direc-
tory as the current directory:

	chmod 700 hpcm_extract
	mkdir hpcm
	hpcm_extract hpcm < help.email
	chmod 700 hpcm/help/sh/*

This will extract all the files into the directory
hpcm/help and make the files in hpcm/help/sh executable.

At this point you can remove the files help.email and
hpcm_extract from your home directory.  There will be
another copy of hpcm_extract in the hpcm/help/sh direc-
tory.

Next you need to set two new HPCM environment variables
and your PATH variable.  Assuming the judge's address is
`fee<fi@fo.fum>', and assuming your use the `csh' shell,
the environment variables can be set by putting the
lines

	setenv HPCM_ADDRESS 'fee<fi@fo.fum>'
	setenv HPCM_HOME ~/hpcm
	set path=(~/hpcm/help/sh $path)

in your `~/.cshrc' file.  If instead you use the Bourne
shell, put the lines

	HPCM_ADDRESS='fee<fi@fo.fum>'
	HPCM_HOME=$HOME/hpcm
	export HPCM_ADDRESS HPCM_HOME
	PATH=$HOME/hpcm/help/sh:$PATH

in your `~/.profile' file.  In either case, after edit-
ing the relevant file, log out and log back in again,
and then check for errors by typing the UNIX commands

	echo "$HPCM_ADDRESS"
	echo $HPCM_HOME

Lastly, to automatically extract files from email
replies to requests generated by hpcm_get, put a copy
of `~/hpcm/help/sh/procmailrc' in your `~/.procmailrc'
file.  This is all you need to do if your UNIX system
uses the procmail program to deliver mail (as for
RedHat Linux).  If your system delivers mail using a
different mailer (as does SUN UNIX), you may have to
put the following line in your `~/.forward' file:

    "| exec /usr/bin/procmail"

to cause your `~/.procmailrc' file to be used (include
the "'s in the `~/.forward' file).  Here `/usr/bin/
procmail' should be identical to the output of the UNIX
command `which procmail'.

If you cannot arrange for automatic extraction of files
gotten by hpcm_get, you will have to manually input each
reply containing files to the `hpcm_extract' UNIX
command.  E.g., copy a reply into a file `foo' and
execute the command:

	hpcm_extract < foo

Note that because HPCM_HOME is now set properly, you do
not have to give a directory argument to hpcm_extract.


Commands that Do NOT Work
-------- ---- -- --- ----

The following commands do NOT work for an email contest.

	print, print2,		You must print your.
	fprint, lpq		email or files extracted
				therefrom.
	scoreboard		See the scoreboard URL
				instead.
	help			You must print the email
				reply to `get help' or
				files extracted there-
				from.


Testing the Demo in a UNIX System
------- --- ---- -- - ---- ------

The UNIX command `hpcm_get' will get all the demonstra-
tion files into the `~/hpcm/demos' directory.  If you
go to the `~/hpcm/demos/count' subdirectory, you will
find a demonstration problem complete with solutions in
all the supported programming languages.  The README
file in this directory will tell you how to install
any of these solutions and practice running it and
submitting it.


Working Problems in a UNIX System
------- -------- -- - ---- ------

You can find out what problems are available by looking
at the file `~/hpcm/help/problems'.  Suppose you decide
to attempt a problem named `pppp' in the C++ language.
Then execute the UNIX command `hcpm_get problems/ppp'
which will send email to the autojudge to get that
problem.  After files are extracted from the reply, the
the problem will be in the directory `~/hpcm/problems/
pppp'.  The `pppp.txt' file in that directory will
describe the problem.  The `Makefile' in that directory
will permit you to compile, run, and submit the problem,
and will contain the resource limits applied to the
problem during judging.

To write a solution to the problem in C++, you need to
write the file `~/hpcm/problems/pppp/pppp.cc'.  See
`~/hpcm/help/solving' for more details.


Using Your Home Directory as Your HPCM Directory
----- ---- ---- --------- -- ---- ---- ---------

You can use `~' (your home directory) as your HPCM
directory instead of using `~/hpcm'.  To do so, make
the following changes in the above instructions.

First, after acquiring the files help.email and
hpcm_extract in your home directory, use the UNIX
commands:

	chmod 700 hpcm_extract
	hpcm_extract < help.email
	chmod 700 help/sh/*

in place of the commands given above.  Second, simply
do not set the HPCM_HOME environment variable: if it
is not set, it defaults to `~'.  Third, edit your the
inclusion into your `~/.procmailrc' file to replace

	`hpcm/help/sh/hpcm_extract hpcm'
by
	`help/sh/hpcm_extract'

and	`hpcm/get_mbox' by `get_mbox'.
