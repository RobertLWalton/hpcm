Email Contest Help	    Tue Sep 24 06:53:53 EDT 2002

In order to participate in an email contest, you need an
account on a machine of your own in which to solve prob-
lems.  This account should support the programming lang-
uages you want to use, and should support email.  This
account will communicate with the contest autojudge
through email.

The Simplest Contest
--- -------- -------

For the simplest contest you are given a web page with
complete instructions and problem descriptions.  The
word `contest' is something of a misnomer for this
activity, as there is no scoring, and no accounting of
how long someone takes to solve a problem.

The contest web page contains the email address of an
autojudge.  In order to submit a solution, you simply
email a solution file to the autojudge.  The subject
of this message must be

	Subject: submit pppp.eee

where pppp is the name of the problem and .eee is an
extension that designates the programming language in
which the solution file is written.  Some possible
extensions are

	.c		C
	.cc		C++
	.java		JAVA
	.lsp		COMMONLISP

The body of the email message must contain the solution
file and nothing else (the file must NOT be an attach-
ment).  The solution file must be a one file program
that reads from the standard input and writes to the
standard output and does NOT open any files.

For the simplest contest problems are not usually timed
and submitters are not ranked in any order.  There is
typically a `scoreboard' that lists submitters who have
solved a problem in alphabetic order and shows for each
submitter the problems the submitter has solved and the
date of each solution.

Sometimes the set of contestant email addresses is re-
stricted.  For example, only email with a sender address
ending in `.harvard.edu' might be accepted by the auto-
judge.

Private Contests
------- --------

Private contests are protected by a password.  The email
address of the autojudge typically has the form
`fee<fie@fo.fum>' where `fee' is a password that is not
to be revealed to the public.  The contest typically has
a web page with URL of the form

	www.fiddle/~diddle/private/fee

where fee is the same password as in the email address,
and `private' is a directory that cannot be read by the
public, so to access the web page a person has to know
the password.

You should not put the URL in any public web page, so as
not to reveal this password.  The scoreboard is posted
on the web page, along with information about how to
participate in the contest.


Getting Help Files
------- ---- -----

Help files giving details about contests are usually on
public web pages.  Given an email contest, one can get
a complete set of help files by sending email to the
autojudge with the subject `get help' and an empty mes-
sage body.  The reply will contain many files (including
this file).  The files are separated by lines of the
form:

	---<>--<>---<>--<>---<>----- filename:

You should first search the reply for and read the file
named `help/this_contest'.  This gives information about
the specific email contest.

If you have a UNIX system, follow the directions in the
file `help/email_unix_tools' that is part of the reply,
and do NOT read the rest of the help file you are cur-
rently reading.  If you do NOT have a UNIX system, con-
tinue reading.


Getting Started on a Non-UNIX System
------- ------- -- - -------- ------

If you do NOT have a UNIX system, you need NOT extract
any files from email replies.  You will probably want to
print the reply to the `get help' message and read many
of the `help' files therein.  You can ignore all the
`help/sh' and `help/tcl' files, as these are UNIX tools.

Demonstration problems are also typically on the web,
but a complete set of demonstration files can be
obtained by sending a message to the autojudge with the
subject `get demos' and empty body.

You can practice submitting a solution by sending one
of the `demos/count' solutions to the autojudge.  For
example, if you send a message to the autojudge with
the subject `submit count.c' and a body equal to the
contents of the `demos/count/count1.c' file, you should
get back a reply saying the submission was `Completely
Correct'.  Read the `demos/count/README' file for more
details.

Needless to say, NONE of the UNIX commands that support
a contest account will work if you do not have a UNIX
system.  You CANNOT use `print', `scoreboard', `make',
`help', etc.



Working Problems on a Non-UNIX System
------- -------- -- - -------- ------

You can find out what problems are available by looking
at the file `help/problems' (in the reply to the
`get help' message).  Suppose you decide to attempt a
problem named `pppp' in the C++ language.  Send email to
the autojudge with the subject `get problems/pppp' and
an empty body.  The reply will contain a description of
the problem in the form of a file with a name like one
of the following:

    problems/pppp/pppp.txt	ASCII text.
    problems/pppp/pppp.html	HTML.
    problems/pppp/pppp.htm	HTML.
    problems/pppp/pppp.ps	Postscript.

The reply also contains a file named `problems/pppp/
Makefile' which is not of direct use, since you do not
have a UNIX system, but which does contain the resource
limits applied to the problem during judging.

Then write a solution to the problem in C++ as a file
named pppp.cc.  To submit the solution, send email to
the autojudge with subject `submit pppp.cc' and message
body equal to just the contents of the file `pppp.cc'.
If it is more convenient, you can use a name other than
`pppp.cc' for the file name, but you MUST use `submit
pppp.cc' as the email subject.

Programming languages other than C++ can be used by
changing the .cc to a different extension, as indicated
near the beginning of this help file.
