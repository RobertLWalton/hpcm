Email Contest Help	    Mon Feb 18 11:41:06 EST 2002

In order to participate in an email contest, you need an
account on a machine of your own in which to solve prob-
lems.  This account should support the programming lang-
uages you want to use, and should support email.  This
account will communicate with the contest autojudge
through email.

Contest Definition
------- ----------

You will be given an email address to use in communica-
ting with the autojudge.  This email address typically
has the form `fee<fie@fo.fum>' where `fee' is a password
that is not to be revealed to the public.  You will
also typically be given a web URL of the form

	www.fiddle/~diddle/private/fee

where fee is the same password as in the email address.
You should not put the URL in any public web page, so as
not to reveal this password.  The `private' directory
here is not readable by the public, so to access the web
page a person has to know the password.  The scoreboard
will be posted on the web page, along with information
about how to participate in the contest.

Alternatively, sometimes the email address does not con-
tain a private password and the URL is not private, but
instead the set of contestant email addresses is re-
stricted.  For example, only email with a sender address
ending in `.harvard.edu' might be accepted by the auto-
judge.


Getting Started
------- -------

To get started, send email to the email address of the
autojudge with the subject `get help' and an empty mes-
sage body.  The reply will contain many files (including
this file).  The files are separated by lines of the
form:

	---<>--<>---<>--<>---<>----- filename:

You should first search the reply for and read the file
named `help/this_contest'.  This gives information about
the specific email contest.

If you have a UNIX system, follow the directions in the
file `help/email_unix_tools' that is part of the reply,
and do NOT read the rest of the help file you are cur-
rently reading.  If you do NOT have a UNIX system, con-
tinue reading.


Getting Started on a Non-UNIX System
------- ------- -- - -------- ------

If you do NOT have a UNIX system, you need NOT extract
any files from email replies.  You will probably want to
print the reply to the `get help' message and read most
of the `help' files therein.  You can ignore all the
`help/sh' and `help/tcl' files, as these are UNIX tools.

Then you can send a message to the autojudge with the
subject `get demos' and read the appropriate parts of
the reply.

You can practice submitting a solution by sending one
of the `demos/count' solutions to the autojudge.  For
example, if you send a message to the autojudge with
the subject `submit count.c' and a body equal to the
contents of the `demos/count/count1.c' file, you should
get back a reply saying the submission was `Completely
Correct'.  Read the `demos/count/README' file for more
details.

Needless to say, NONE of the UNIX commands that support
a contest account will work if you do not have a UNIX
system.  You CANNOT use `print', `scoreboard', `make',
`help', etc.



Working Problems on a Non-UNIX System
------- -------- -- - -------- ------

You can find out what problems are available by looking
at the file `help/problems' (in the reply to the
`get help' message).  Suppose you decide to attempt a
problem named `pppp' in the C++ language.  Send email to
the autojudge with the subject `get problems/pppp' and
an empty body.  The reply will contain a description of
the problem in the form of a file with a name like one
of the following:

    problems/pppp/pppp.txt	ASCII text.
    problems/pppp/pppp.html	HTML.
    problems/pppp/pppp.htm	HTML.
    problems/pppp/pppp.ps	Postscript.

The reply also contains a file named `problems/pppp/
Makefile' which is not of direct use, since you do not
have a UNIX system, but which does contain the resource
limits applied to the problem during judging.

Then write a solution to the problem in C++ as a file
named pppp.cc.  To submit the solution, send email to
the autojudge with subject `submit pppp.cc' and message
body equal to just the contents of the file `pppp.cc'.
If it is more convient, you can use a name other than
`pppp.cc' for the file name, but you MUST use `submit
pppp.cc' as the email subject.
