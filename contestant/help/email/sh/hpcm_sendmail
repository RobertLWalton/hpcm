    Sends the email in the email_file to the judge.
    Similar to sendmail -oi -t but adds its own \`To:'
    field, which should not be included in the email_
    file.
	
    The mail is sent to the address in the first read-
    able HPCM_ADDRESS file found by searching the
    current directory and its ancestors, and the mail is
    cc'ed to the sending user account."
