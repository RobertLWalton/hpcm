# You should edit this file by first setting the
# following parameters properly, and then editing
# the `:0 B' entries below the place where it says
# `CONTINUE EDITING:'.

# Additions to your path that you need to run:
#
#    The files in ONE of your contest home directory's	
#    `help/sh' subdirectories.
#
#    The `bash' program, if necessary.
#
# Include a `:' after EACH added path directory.
#
# Note: If you get this PATH wrong, hpcm_extract will
# fail without any any error messages.
#
# Note: Don't assume the example values given below
# will work for you.

  # For each contest for which you have a home direc-
  # tory, provide a `:0 B' entry to set HPCM_HOME to the
  # contest home directory.  The word between ${BEFORE}
  # and ${AFTER} is the password for the contest; that
  # is, it is the `fee' in the contest email address
  # `fee<fi@fo.fum>'.  The HPCM_HOME value is the home
  # directory of the contest.

  # Note: if HPCM_HOME is set to a non-existant direc-
