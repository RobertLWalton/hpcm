THIS FILE IS UNEDITED AND INACCURATE!

This `contest' should help you practice for programming
contests, should you wish to participate in such, but
should also give you valuable hands on experience with
basic computer science algorithms, even if you do not
wish to participate in programming contests.

This contest is intended to be done individually, and
NOT by teams (though you can work as a team if you
want).  You provide your own account.  You do each prob-
lem by itself, at a time of your own choosing, indepen-
dent of when you do any other problem.  See the help/
problems file for a list of problems.  The problems are
classified there by the type of algorithm they employ.

Information about this contest, including the score-
board, is posted at

The email address of this contest is:

Sending a message to this address with the subject field
value `get help' and an empty message body will get all
the `help' files that document this contest.  In the
reply to the `get help' message, all these `help' files
will be separated by lines that begin with `---<>'.

This is an `email' contest.  Look at the file `help/
email_contest' for more details about email contests.
The file you are reading now is the `help/this_contest'
file.

If you look at the `help/email_unix_tools' file, you
will find instructions for extracting all the files from
the mail message reply that contains them, if you have a
UNIX system with the correct shell program.

In order to get good time scores on problems, you must
AVOID getting a problem description (as described in
the help files) UNTIL you are READY to swiftly solve it.
However, you may wish to do problems for other reasons
than getting good time scores.

Good hunting!
