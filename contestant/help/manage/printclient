Print Client
----- ------

The printclient and printserver work to enable remote
printing where the client provides the server manager
with a public key and the printclient program uses
the associated private key to log into the printserver
and pull files to be printed by the printclient.

The client creates a public/private key pair useable
by ssh, sends the public key to the server manager,
and stores the private key in the file PRIVATEKEY.
The server manager sends back an ssh account name of
the form ACCOUNT@HOST.  Then the printclient program
can be invoked via

    cd WORKINGDIRECTORY
    printclient PRIVATEKEY ACCOUNT@HOST LINEPRINTER

Files to be printed are placed in a directory on the
server along with companion metadata files.  These are
copied to the WORKINGDIRECTORY of the client, and the
files to be printed are printed.  The client and host
then delete the printed files but keep the metadata
files for later display.
