Informal Contest Help	    Thu Oct  6 11:37:44 EDT 2005


Informal contests are a way of practicing for formal
contests using timed scoring.  In an informal contest
you get each problem individually, and get the problem
description as a file only when you get the problem.
The start time of the problem is either the time you get
the problem, or the time you get the first problem in
the contest.

An informal contest can be set up so each team can par-
ticipate at a different time, say one on Sunday after-
noon and another on Tuesday evening.  Or an informal
contest can be set up so each contestant can solve each
problem at a different time.

Rules for Informal Contests:
----- --- -------- --------

You will be given a contest account name and a password,
either by email or on a sheet of paper.   You can log
into the contest account from anywhere (e.g., if there
are not enough terminals in one place you can go to any
other place, or you can work at `home').

You must use the secure shell (ssh) to log into the
contest computers.  You may use an X-Terminal equivalent
(X-server) in combination with ssh.  If you use an
X-Terminal equivalent, you can make new windows easily
with xcsh: see `help xterminals'.

You may be able to use the print commands in an informal
contest, if you are located in the same building as the
printer.  The command `printer' will tell you the name
of the printer.  Otherwise you can set up your account
to either use a different printer or to e-mail post-
script files of printouts to the e-mail address of your
choice.  See `help print'.

The `scoreboard' and `help' commands work for an
informal contest.

If you are simulating a formal contest precisely, you
will not be allowed to use the alternative make commands
that `in-submit' or `inout-submit'.  However `solution-
submit' may work.

Your contest account will normally remain for some
longish period of time after the contest so you can
log in and email out your solutions, in order to save
them.
