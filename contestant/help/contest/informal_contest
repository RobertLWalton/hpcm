Rules for Informal Contests:
----- --- -------- --------

You will be given a contest account name and a password,
either by email or on a sheet of paper.   You can log
into the contest account from anywhere (e.g., if there
are not enough terminals in one place you can go to any
other place, or you can work at `home').

You must use the secure shell (ssh) to log into the
contest computers.  You may use an X-Terminal equivalent
(X-server) in combination with ssh.  If you use an
X-Terminal equivalent, you can make new windows easily
with xcsh: see `help xterminals'.

You may be able to use the print commands in an informal
contest, if you are located in the same building ast the
printer.  The command `lpq' will tell you the name of
the printer.  Otherwise you will have to email files
you want to print from your contest account to an
account that can access a printer hear you.

The `scoreboard' and `help' commands work for an
informal contest.

Your contest account will normally remain for some
longish period of time after the contest so you can
log in and email out your solutions, in order to save
them.
