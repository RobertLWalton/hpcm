THIS FILE IS UNEDITED AND INACCURATE!

The command `help' will display this file.

This is a `formal' contest.  The command

	help formal_contest

displays more details about formal contests.

The contest managers will log in for you.  You will NOT
be given a password.  If you have an xterminal, the xcsh
command will make more windows: see `help xterminals'.

The contest managers will inform you in writing which
account you will be using.  It is your responsibility
to double check that the contest managers have logged
you into the right account.

The command `hpcm_get' will get a demonstration problem
into your directory ~/demos/count (where ~ denotes your
home directory).  Read ~/demos/count/README and ~/demos/
count/Makefile and practice submitting the demonstra-
tion problem.

Hpcm_get will also get all the contest problems into
your `~/problems' directory AFTER the contest official-
ly starts.  At the contest start time, you will be given
a printout of all the problem descriptions.  The command
`help problems' will display a list of all the problems
AFTER the contest starts.  Also see `help solving'.

The command `scoreboard' will display the scoreboard.
The time of a problem is the time between the start
time of the contest and the time a solution is submit-
ted.  See `help scoreboard'.

To display a list of the help files available use the
command `help index'.  Note that if something in the
index has the name `help/topic' you use the command
`help topic' to view it.

To send a question to the contest manager DO NOT try
to e-mail the manager directly.  Instead edit the ques-
tion into a file qqq and use the command:

	hpcm_sendmail < qqq

Output of the print commands (see `help print') will
be brought to you.  Please do NOT try to find the
printer.  For more information see `help print'.

You CANNOT use the alternative submit commands that
make `in-submit', `inout-submit', or `solution-submit'.
These are only for practice contests.

You CANNOT use a web browser.  The `javahelp' command
gives on-line Java documentation: see `help java'.  You
may use any printed matterial you like, but cannot
communicate electronically with the world outside the
contest.

Good hunting!
