THIS FILE IS UNEDITED AND INACCURATE!

The command `help' will display this file.

This is a `formal' contest.  The command

	help formal_contest

displays more details about formal contests.

The contest managers will log in for you.  You will NOT
be given a password.  If you have an xterminal, the xcsh
command will make more windows: see `help xterminals'.

The command `hpcm_get' will get a demonstration problem
into your directory ~/demos/count (where ~ denotes your
home directory).  Read ~/demos/count/README and ~/demos/
count/Makefile and practice submitting the demonstra-
tion problem.

Hpcm_get will also get all the contest problems into
your `~/problems' directory AFTER the contest official-
ly starts.  At the contest start time, you will be given
a printout of all the problem descriptions.  The command
`help problems' will display a list of all the problems
AFTER the contest starts.  Also see `help solving'.

The command `scoreboard' will display the scoreboard.
The time of a problem is the time between the start
time of the contest and the time a solution is submit-
ted.

To display a list of the help files available use the
command `help index'.  Note that if something in the
index has the name `help/topic' you use the command
`help topic' to view it.

To send a question to the contest manager edit the
question into a file qqq and use the command:

	hpcm_sendmail < qqq

Output of the print commands (see `help print') will
be brought to you.  Please do NOT try to find the
printer.  For more information see `help print'.

Good hunting!
