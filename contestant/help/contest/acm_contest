General Contest Rules
------- ------- -----

An ACM contest has 3-person teams but only one terminal
per team.  The problem descriptions are on paper only,
and are handed out at the start of the contest.  The
contest starts at 10am and stops at 3pm.  Scoring is by
the number of problems solved, with ties broken by the
times required to solve problems, as explained in more
detail below.

All contestants run on the same fast computer and are
therefore subject to the same load.  There may be
differences in terminals assigned to contestants, so to
ensure fairness, terminals are assigned to contestants
at random (e.g., by using dice throws).

You participate in an ACM contest by going to a contest
host site.  There the contest managers will give you a
terminal and an account name, and log in for you.  You
will NOT be given any password.  Please check to be SURE
your team account name matches the account logged into
the terminal you are given.  The `help terminals' com-
mand gives information about making extra terminal
windows.

The `help print' command gives information about print-
ing files.  Your printouts will be brought to you.  Do
NOT try to find the printer.  If a printout has not been
brought to you promptly, ask the contest support person-
nel to check the printer.

During an ACM contest:

  1. You may not use web browsers.
  
  2. You may not communicate electronically with anyone
     but the contest judge.
     
  3. You may not use calculators or computers other than
     the one provide to you for logging into your
     account.
     
  4. You may not communicate verbally with anyone except
     members of your team and contest support personnel.

These rules are VERY IMPORTANT.

Of course purely personal communications not about
contest details are exempt from these rules.

You may bring and use any printed material you like.
There are contest commands to display some language
specific documentation; see the language specific help
files (e.g., `help c++', `help java'). 	You may also
print algorithmic help files, see `help algorithms'.


What Problems?
--------------

Problems are solved in problem directories.  When you
are first logged in, these do not yet exist.  You have
to get them by executing

	hpcm_get

Before the contest starts this will just get problem
directories for demo problems.  The directory for a demo
problem named `pppp' is named `~/demos/pppp'.  Problem
directories are where you write your solutions, and they
each contain an important file named `Makefile' that
defines operations you will need in order to solve and
submit the problem.  Solutions to the demo problems are
put by `hpcm_get' into the `~/demos/solutions' direc-
tory.  You can display an index of demo problems with
the `help demos' command.

You should test the contest tools on the demo problems
before the contest starts.  You can copy solutions from
`demos/solutions' to demo problem directories and try
submitting them (see below for how to do this), for
example.

Then after the contest starts at 10 am you need to exe-
cute `hpcm_get' again, JUST ONCE, to get all the problem
directories.  A contest problem with name `pppp' has a
directory named `~/problems/pppp'.  You can display an
index of contest problems with the `help problems'
command.


Asking Questions
----------------

In an ACM contest you can ask contest support people
at your host site about programming tools, but not about
particular problems.  If you have a question about a
particular problem, you must email the judge using a
method that is slightly weird.  First, edit your email
into a file of your own choosing.  If your first line
has the form

	Subject: ....

and the next line is completely empty (no spaces),
then the first line will be the subject line of the
message.  Then

	hpcm_sendmail < filename

to send the file as email to the judges.

Note that the subject must NOT begin with the words
`submit' or `get'.

Email to the judge by other means during an ACM contest
will not be seen by the judge during the contest.

If the judge chooses to clarify a problem, the clarifi-
cation will be posted on the scoreboard so everyone can
see it, rather than returned to you by email.


Working on a Problem
--------------------

For a problem named `pppp' you should write a file named
`pppp.c', `pppp.cc', `pppp.java', or `pppp.lsp' in your
`~/problems/pppp' directory.  The suffix of the file you
write determines the programming language you are using:

	.c 	for C		   see `help c'
	.cc	for C++		   see `help c++'
	.java	for JAVA	   see `help java'
	.lsp	for COMMONLISP	   see `help commonlisp'

You must write only ONE of these files; you CANNOT have
a solution in two different languages at once.  For each
language there is a language specific help file detail-
ing how to write solutions in that language.

After you write your program, execute the `make' command
in the problem directory.  This will compile your pro-
gram, create a file named `pppp.in', run your program
with `pppp.in' as input and `pppp.out' as output, and
also send the output to our terminal.  You can test this
by copying a solution from `~/demos/solutions' into some
demonstration problem directory `~/demos/pppp' and run-
ning `make' in that directory.  Initially `pppp.in' is
a copy of `sample.in' in the problem directory, and if
your program is correct, the `pppp.out' produced should
be essentially the same as the file `sample.test' in the
problem directory.  You can then edit additional test
data into `pppp.in' to test your program further.


Make Commands
---- --------

The full set of `make' commands you can execute in a
problem directory is:

    make	Same as `make pppp.out' (see below).

    make pppp	Makes the binary program file `pppp' by
                running gcc on pppp.c, or g++ on
		pppp.cc, or javac on pppp.java, etc.
		Does nothing if `pppp' is more up to
		date than pppp.c, pppp.cc, etc.

		In addition to making `pppp', other
		files may be made for some languages,
		e.g., pppp.class for JAVA.

    make pppp.in
		If the file pppp.in does NOT already
		exist and the file sample.in does
		exist, this copies sample.in to pppp.in
		and makes the copy writable (editable)
		so you can add to pppp.in.  If pppp.in
		already exists this does nothing (even
		if sample.in is more recent than
		pppp.in).

		sample.in is the `Sample Input' from the
		problem description.

    make pppp.out
		Makes `pppp' and `pppp.in' as above and
		then runs pppp with standard input com-
		ing from the file pppp.in.  Puts the
		standard output in the file pppp.out,
		and also copies that to the screen.
		Also outputs any standard error output
		to the screen.  Does nothing, however,
		if pppp.out is more recent than both
		pppp.in and pppp.

		Note that the sample.test file, if it
		exists, is the `Sample Output' from the
		problem description, and may be compared
		to pppp.out if pppp.in is a copy of the
		sample.in file.  The match can be made
		with the

			diff sample.test pppp.out

		command, but may not need to be exact:
		see the `scores' help file.

    make pppp.debug
    		Ditto but runs `pppp debug' instead of
		`pppp' and puts the standard output in
		the file `pppp.debug' instead of
		`pppp.out'.  You should write your
		program to output debugging information
		to the standard output if the program is
		given any arguments.

    make debug	Same as `make pppp.debug'.

    make submit
		Makes `pppp.out' just to be sure that
		nothing crashes, and then e-mails
		pppp.c, pppp.cc, pppp.java, or pppp.lsp
		to the judges.  Note the pppp.in file
		MUST exist to submit (in order to make
		pppp.out), but pppp.in can be the
		minimum needed to keep your program from
		crashing.

    make clean	Removes `pppp', pppp.out, pppp.debug,
    		pppp.class, etc.

The `make' UNIX commands work because of the way the
`Makefile' file in the problem directory is written.
The `Makefile' file contains some oddities resulting
from the fact that judges, who use the same `Makefile'
as contestants, run solutions in a sandbox account that
has permission problems accessing judge's files. 


Resource Limits
-------- ------

Some problems have resource limits that require their
solutions to be time and space efficient.

If you look at the `Makefile' in the problem directory
you will see that it contains memory and time resource
limits which constrain your problem.  Memory limits
are typically a few tens of megabytes and time limits
are typically 10 to 30 seconds.  Harder problems require
care to be sure you stay within these limits.


Scoreboard
----------

The `scoreboard' command displays the scoreboard which
contains an entry for each team and problem.  The entry
is `.....' if the team has not submitted any solution
for the problem, `.../N' if the team has submitted N
incorrect solutions, and `TTT/N' if the team has submit-
ted a correct solution and N previous incorrect solu-
tions, where TTT tells the time the team needed to solve
the problem.  Each team also has a total score beneath
its name, which has the form M/RRR.  M is the number of
problems the team has solved - more is better - and RRR
is the sum in seconds of the M times the team took to
solve these problems - more is WORSE.  To see details
about problem times use `help scoreboard'.

If the scoreboard is too long for its display window,
you can scroll down and up with the down and up arrow
keys.  If the scoreboard changes the display will be
updated and will go back to the top of the scoreboard.
Teams are named by their accounts, but you can use the
`who_where' command to find which accounts belong to
which teams.

For each problem you submit, the judge returns an email
with the submission score, and for incorrect submissions
this may have a little bit more detail as to the nature
of the failure: see `help scores'.  In fact you get two
emails per submission, one from the autojudge, and one
from a human judge who manually reviews and confirms the
work of the autojudge.


Other Issues
----- ------

The following help commands may be useful for:

    Printing files:			help print

    Making new terminal windows:	help terminals

    Understanding problem scores:	help scores

    Understanding the scoreboard:	help scoreboard

After the contest ends and the results have been saved,
the contest is converted into an untimed practice and
your coach is emailed account names and passwords to use
in accessing this practice.  The work you have done
remains in your account and you can continue by practic-
ing on the problems you failed to solve.  See `help
untimed_practice' for more details.
