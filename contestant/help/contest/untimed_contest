Untimed Contest Help	    Thu Sep 28 17:14:51 EDT 2006


Untimed contests are an alternative to timed programming
contests.  One common way of scoring untimed contests is
feedback scoring, in which contestants may get feedback
from an autojudge giving the judge's input or output for
failed test cases, and the number and kinds of feedback
determine a ranking score for each problem a contestant
eventually solves correctly.

Because these contests are untimed, they generally have
a web page containing the problem descriptions.  Contes-
tants may be given account names and passwords, or may
be allowed to work on their own computers and simply
email submissions to the autojudge.


Rules for Untimed Contests:
----- --- ------- --------

If you are given a contest account name and a password,
you can log into your contest account from anywhere.
You must use the secure shell (ssh) to log into the
contest computers.  You may use an X-Terminal equivalent
(X-server) in combination with ssh.  If you use an
X-Terminal equivalent, you can make new windows easily
with xcsh: see `help xterminals'.  See `help solving'
to see how to solve problems in this account.  See
`help print' to see how to make a ~/PRINTER file that
will route printouts to a email address of your choice.

If you are not given a contest account name and pass-
word, you will be given an email address to which you
can send submissions.  Read the `email_solving' help
file to see how to solve problems using your own
personal account and this email address.  You cannot
use the standard HPCM commands in your own personal
account, of course, UNLESS you import the email UNIX
tools described in the email_unix_tools help file.
