Formal Contest Help	    Thu Aug 31 13:22:23 EDT 2006


In order to participate in a contest, you need to log
into your contest account.

Normally we make all contestants run on the same fast
computer.  This means that all contestants are subject
to the same load.

Rules for Formal Contests:
----- --- ------ --------

The contest managers will log in for you.  You may or
may not be given an X-Terminal equivalent.  If you are,
you can make more windows using xcsh: see `help
xterminals'.  If not, you must ask the contest managers
to make more windows for you.  Usually in this case all
teams are given the same number of windows to start
with: typically 4.  You will NOT be given any password.

For formal contests you are assigned a location and
account name.  Please type `who am i' to be sure you
have the right account.

In a formal contest your printouts will be brought to
you.  Do NOT try to find the printer.  If a printout has
not been brought to you promptly, ask the contest sup-
port personnel to check the printer.

During a formal contest you may not use web browsers or
electronic communication that is not directly part of
the contest.  You may bring and use any printed matter-
ial you like.  There is a contest command, javahelp, for
on-line Java documentation: see `help java'.

During a formal contest the alternative submit commands
`make in-submit', `make inout-submit', and `make
solution-submit' are NOT allowed.

A few days or so after the contest ends you will be
given the name and password of your contest account so
you can collect the code you wrote.  At this point the
contest will be reconstituted as a practice contest,
so you can additionally submit new code to the auto-
judge, though of course it will not count in the already
finished formal contest.
