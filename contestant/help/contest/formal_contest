Formal Contest Help	    Fri Nov 17 22:00:22 EST 2000


In order to participate in a contest, you need to log
into your contest account.

Normally we make all contestants run on the same fast
computer.  This means that all contestants are subject
to the same load.

Rules for Formal Contests:
----- --- ------ --------

The contest managers will log in for you.  You may or
may not be given an X-Terminal equivalent.  If you are,
you can make more windows using xcsh: see `help
xterminals'.  If not, you must ask the contest managers
to make more windows for you.  Usually in this case all
teams are given the same number of windows to start
with: typically 4.  You will NOT be given any password.

For formal contests you are assigned a location and
and account name.  Please type `who am i' to be sure
you have the right account.

In a formal contest your printouts will be brought to
you.  Do NOT try to find the printer.  If a printout has
not been brought to you promptly, ask the contest sup-
port personnel to check the printer.

At the end of the contest you should email your code
to your accounts in the world outside so you have
a record of what you did.  Note that email coming
into the contest computer may be controlled, but email
out usually is not.
