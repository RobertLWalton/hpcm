In order to participate in a contest, you need to log
into your contest account.

Normally we make all contestants run on the same fast
computer.  This means that all contestants are subject
to the same load.

Rules for Formal Contests:
----- --- ------ --------

The contest managers will log in for you.  You may or
may not be given an X-Terminal equivalent.  If you are,
you can make more windows using xcsh: see below.  If
not, you must ask the contest managers to make more
windows for you.  Usually in this case all teams are
give the same number of windows: typically 4.  You will
NOT be given any password.

For formal contests you are assigned a location and
and account name.  Please type `who am i' to be sure
you have the right account.

At the end of the contest you should email your code
to your accounts in the world outside so you have
a record of what you did.  Note that email coming
into the contest computer is controlled, but email
out is not.
    

Creating Windows with Xcsh
--------------------------

If you are not running on an X terminal emulator, and
you want to make a new window, you will have to ask the
contest managers to make the window for you, since a
login with the password will be required.  There is
usually a maximum number of windows allowed in this
case, and often this maximum number is created for you
before you are given your terminal.

If you are running on an X terminal emulator, to create
a new window you may use the command:

    xcsh    Start a new X terminal window running csh.

            The new window tends to form directly over
	    the top the leftmost existing window, so one
	    of these windows has to be moved.

You can also try:

    xcsh 1   Ditto but with different fonts.
    xcsh 2   Try these out if you do not like the
    xcsh 3   normal font.
    xcsh 4
