hpcm_helper filename command_type

    Helper program for javahelp and similar programs.

    Invokes an approved \`command_type' program.  The
    list of such is read from the contest/filename file,
    which consists of lines of the format:

    	name "command ..."

    Note that the command should be quoted, and will be
    processed as an sh (or bash) shell argument.

    If there is only one line, that is selected.  If
    there are more than one, the user is given the
    option of which one to choose.  If there is no
    readable contest/filename file, the user is
    notified.

    Lines beginning with \`#' in the contest/filename
    file are ignored, as are blank lines.

    The command_type is used in the messages:

        Select the command_type you want:
        NO command_type is available.

    Contests differ in the command_type commands they
    allow.  E.g., a contest some of whose terminals do
    not have X-windows will usually allow only lynx
    based JAVA documentation display commands."
