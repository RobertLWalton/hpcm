fprint [filename ...]

    Print the files named (or the standard input if
    the filenames are missing) in a format well suited
    to files with lines of 80 columns.   This format
    puts 2 file pages per paper page, and permits at
    least 60 lines on a file page.

    If ~/.hpcm_contest/printer is readable the name of
    the printer is read from this file.

    If ~/.hpcm_contest/who_where is readable the name of
    the current account is mapped so this file's WHERE
    field is printed in the page header in place of the
    current account name.

    If ~/.hpcm_contest/printer_jobs is writable a line
    giving the date and WHERE field (or account name)
    is written to that file."
