print [filename ...]
pdf [filename ...]

    Print the files named (or the standard input if
    the filenames are missing) in a format well suited
    to files with lines of 80 columns.   This format
    puts 1 file page per paper page, and permits at
    least 60 lines on a file page.

    If called with the name \`pdf', makes a .pdf file
    instead of printing.  If the first filename has the
    form xxx.yyy, a .pdf file with the name xxx-yyy.pdf
    is made.  If there are no file names, a file with
    the name input.pdf is made.

    If ~/.hpcm_contest/who_where is readable the name of
    the current account is mapped so this account's
    WHERE field is printed in the page header in place
    of the current account name, unless the WHERE field
    is \`WHERE' or \`where' or the account does not
    match any line in ~/.hpcm_contest/who_where.

    For printing the \`printer_pipe' program is used to
    locate the printer and update ~/.hpcm_contest/
    printer_jobs."
