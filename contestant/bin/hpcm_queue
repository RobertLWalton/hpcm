    Copy the standard input to a file in the queue-
    directory.  The file name is initially

    	year-month-day-hour-minute-second-ID.out

    where ID is the ID of the process executing this
    program.  After the copy is completed, the file
    extension is changed from to .out to \`extension',
    where \`extension' must include the leading \`.'
    and may be empty.

    The -local option is equivalent to the two arguments

    	~/printerq .ps

    In addition, in this case ~/printerq is made if it
    does not exist.
