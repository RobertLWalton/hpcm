fprint [filename ...]

    Print the files named (or the standard input if
    the filenames are missing) in a format well suited
    to files with lines of 56 columns.   This format
    puts 2 file pages per paper page, and permits at
    least 40 lines in a file page.

    If ~/.hpcm_contest/who_where is readable the name of
    the current account is mapped so this account's
    WHERE field is printed in the page header in place
    of the current account name, unless the WHERE field
    is \`WHERE' or \`where' or the account does not
    match any line in ~/.hpcm_contest/who_where.

    The \`printer_pipe' program is used to locate the
    printer and update ~/.hpcm_contest/printer_jobs."
