The current version of printer_client is
to be tested and may change.

<P>
The printer_client program is used by a host site
to print files in a BOSPRE printer queue that contains the
files to be printed at that host site.
The current version enables printing to be done from any linux
computer equipped with a printer.  The printer_client is written
in bash 3.2, and should work also work on a MAC.
