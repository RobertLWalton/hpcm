    Execute COMMONLISP interpreter.  If no -* option
    is given, the hpcm_clisp.lsp file is loaded, and
    any arguments given to this program are passed to
    the RUN function in that file.  If input-file is
    given, it replaces terminal input, and if output-
    file is given, it replaces standard output.  If
    t is given as the input file, the standard input
    is used but is echoed.

    For this case see documentation obtainable from
    
    	\`(documentation 'run 'function)
    	\`(documentation 'vi 'function)
    	\`(documentation 'vil 'function)
    	\`(documentation 'vir 'function)
    	\`(documentation 'pico 'function)
    	\`(documentation 'picol 'function)
    	\`(documentation 'picor 'function)

    If instead the -i load-file and -x s-expression
    options are given, the load-file is loaded, and then
    the s-expression is evaluated, and there is no read-
    eval-print loop.

    If -I load-file is given, the load-file is loaded
    and (main [arguments..]) is called, and the only
    output is that printed by the \`main' function exe-
    cution.

    If -c load-file is given, the load-file is compiled
    to produce a *.fas compiled file that may be loaded
    with -i or -I.  Other files, such as *.lib files,
    may be produced for use by the compiler.

    If -which is given, this program merely prints
    the absolute name of the hpcm_clisp program that is
    executable in a sandbox.
