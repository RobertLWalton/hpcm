TRASH_ACCOUNT [contest]

    Removes all files from the current account and re-
    loads them from contest/setup.tar.  Checks after re-
    moving files that \`ls -a' equals contest/empty.ls,
    and after reloading that \`ls -aR' equals contest/
    setup.ls.  Before doing anything, checks that the
    current account name is listed on a line by itself
    in contest/trashable, and also checks that files
    such as contest/home/setup.tar are readable.  If the
    contest argument is not given, it is taken to be the
    target of the symbolic link ~/.hpcm_contest, if that
    exists.  If this program succeeds, it links ~/.hpcm_
    contest to the value of the contest argument.

    After doing the above successfully, if the file
    .hpcm_contest/extra_setup.tar is readable, this
    program executes in the account home directory
    
    	tar xpvf .hpcm_contest/extra_setup.tar

    For example, extra_setup.tar can be used to put ssh
    authorization into the current (contestant) account,
    so a judge can ssh to the current account without
    using the account password.  To do this, just pre-
    pare the contest extra_setup.tar file as follows.

    Extra_setup.tar is prepared by working in the
    judge's account.  First prepare an appropriate
    ~/.ssh/identity.pub file.  Then execute

	cd SOME-DIRECTORY-OTHER-THAN-~
	mkdir .ssh
	chmod 700 .ssh
	cp ~/.ssh/identity.pub .ssh/authorized_keys
	chmod 400 .ssh/authorized_keys
	tar cf extra_setup.tar .ssh

    If your ssh uses ssh protocol 2 instead of ssh pro-
    tocol 1, then you should use the files id_rsa.pub
    and authorized_keys2, instead of identity.pub and
    authorized_keys."
