printer_pipe [-P] where filename [username]

    Look up the printer in the
    
    	~/.hpcm_contest/printer_map

    file if that is readable, or the
    
    	~/.hpcm_contest/printer
    
    file otherwise, or if neither file is readable, use
    the PRINTER environment variable.
    
    The printer_map file has lines with the format:

    	regular-expression printer

    For the first line whose regular expression matches
    the user name, the printer is used.  If there are
    no matches and the file exists, it is an error
    (the `printer' file and PRINTER variable are NOT
    used).

    The `printer' file contents just name the printer.

    If the printer name begins with a `!', the rest of
    the name is take as the name of a file in which to
    find the printer name.  It is an error if this file
    is not readable.  If the file is readable the
    printer name is just the contents of the file (no
    further indirection is allowed).  Tilde and glob
    expansions are performed on the file name.

    If the user name is not given, the current account
    name is used.

    If the -P option is given, the printer name is
    written to the standard output, and this program
    exits without trying to print anything.  The where
    and filename arguments are not used in this case
    (unless they are needed to specify a user argument).
    Otherwise this program continues and prints the
    standard input.

    The standard input to this program should be a
    file to be piped to the printer.  It is usually a
    postscript file, but can be ASCII with form feeds.

    If the printer name contains an `@' the standard
    input is emailed to the printer name.  Otherwise
    the standard input is piped to \`lpr -Pprinter'.

    If ~/.hpcm_contest/printer_jobs is writable a line
    giving the date and where field is written to that
    file.

    The \`where' and \`filename' arguments are used
    purely for informative purposes in the email subject
    and in ~/.hpcm_contest/printer_jobs."
