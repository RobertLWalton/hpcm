    Invokes an approved JAVA API web document displayer.
    The list of such displayer's is read from the
    contest/javahelp file, which consists of lines of
    the format:

    	dislayer-name "display-command ..."

    Note that the display-command must be quoted, and
    will be processed as an sh shell argument.

    If there is only one line, that is selected.  If
    there are more than one, the user is given the option
    of which one to choose.  If there is no readable
    contest/javahelp file, the user is notified.

    Lines beginning with \`#' in the contest/javahelp
    file are ignored, as are blank lines.

    Contests differ in the javahelp commands they allow.
    A contest some of whose terminals do not have X-
    windows will usually allow only lynx based JAVA
    documentation display, for example."
