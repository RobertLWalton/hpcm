    This program installs ssh public keys in the current
    account.  Specifically, all public keys with file
    names of the form *_*.pub in either the home or
    ~/.ssh directories are made active.  Note that
    public key names must contain \`_'; the *_* part of
    the name should be unique and should identify the
    account containing the corresponding private key.

    WARNING: These accounts are NOT completely private:
    the judge may access them (but usually does not).

    First, if the ~/.ssh directory does not exist it is
    made.
    
    Second, any files named ~/*_*.pub are moved into the
    ~/.ssh directory.  Note this may overwrite files in
    that directory that have the same last name compo-
    nent.
    
    Then this program makes a temporary file that is
    the concatenation of all files with names of the
    form

	~/.hpcm_contest/.ssh/*.pub
	~/.ssh/*_*.pub

    The ~/.hpcm_contest/.ssh/*_*.pub keys can be used by
    the contest manager to access the account.

    If ./ssh/authorized_keys equals this temporary file,
    the temporary is deleted and nothing further is
    done.

    Otherwise this program uses

    	cd ~/.ssh
	mkdir RCS
	ci -l authorized_keys

    to back up ~/.ssh/authorized_keys and then replaces
    ~/.ssh/authorized_keys by the temporary file."
