You are about to start the elinks page viewer.

It is important to remember that if you want a menu you must type F9.  Then
`Help' is a menu item.  Under the `Help' menu item try `Keys' (BUT, in the
`Keys' display you move with non-standard keys: tab goes to the OK box and up
and down arrow scroll up and down).

Another important this is that to enter text, you must FIRST type ENTER,
then the text, then ENTER again.

In addition to using terminal keys you can click on link to move to
the page linked to.  This is by far the easiest way to move to an new
page.

The most common commands for this viewer are:

    q: quit
    Up or Down Keys: Move between links on the current page.
    Right or Left Arrow Keys: Go to the page of the
          current link or return to the previous page.
    / text or ? text: Search down or up
    n or N: Continue search in forward or reverse direction.
    Delete or Insert: Scroll down or up.
    { or }: Scroll left or right.
