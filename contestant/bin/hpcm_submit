            problem[.extension] [file ...]

    Submits the files for the problem.  Only the base-
    name of each file is transmitted as part of the
    submission, so \`foo/bar' appears to the judge as
    just \`bar'.

    If no files are given, the problem name with exten-
    sion is taken to be the name of a single file.  If
    in this case there is no extension, one of the fol-
    lowing extensions is selected

    	$extensions
    
    so that the file problem.extension is readable.  It
    is an error if no suitable extensions are found or
    more than one is found.

    Some possible qualifiers are-

      in	Return judge's input for first case
		where problem had Incorrect Output or
		a Formatting Error.

      inout	Ditto but return both judge's input and
		output.

      solution  On Completely Correct submission, return
      		judge's solution.

    Different qualifiers are legal for different con-
    tests.  Most contests do not permit any qualifiers.
    
    The -test option if present is passed to the
    hpcm_sendmail program."
